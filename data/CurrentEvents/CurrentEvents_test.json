The start of the year has been dominated by the January 2025 Southern California wildfires, which have devastated Greater Los Angeles. Following his election victory in November, Donald Trump was inaugurated and began his second, non-consecutive term on January 20. The beginning of his term saw him extensively use executive orders and give increased authority to Elon Musk through the Department of Government Efficiency, leading to mass layoffs of the federal workforce and attempts to dismantle agencies such as USAID. These policies have drawn dozens of lawsuits that have challenged their legality."

The number of constituencies each party wins in each state is subtracted from its allocation to arrive at the final number of list seats. The list seats won by each party are allocated using closed lists drawn up by each party within each state.\nGermany has a mixed-member proportional electoral system. Voters have two votes: the first is used to elect a candidate directly in their constituency using first-past-the-post, and the second is for a party's electoral list. To enter the Bundestag, a party must either get five percent of the nationwide second vote or win three constituencies via first votes – passing the electoral threshold. Either case results in that party entering the Bundestag and receiving seats in proportion to its national share of the second vote.

On the same day, Chancellor Scholz announced he would submit a motion of confidence to hold a snap election; this was initially planned for January 2025 for a late March election but was brought forward after pressure from the opposition.\nFederal elections were held in Germany on 23 February 2025 to elect the 630 members of the 21st Bundestag, down from 736 in 2021 due to reforms in seat distribution. The 2025 election took place seven months ahead of schedule due to the 2024 collapse of the incumbent governing coalition. Following the loss of his majority, the chancellor called and intentionally lost a motion of confidence, which enabled the approval of a new election by the president. The 2025 election was the fourth early election in post-war German history, and the first since 2005.\nCzech Republic: Prime Minister Petr Fiala called for greater cooperation between the next German government and hoped for success in the forthcoming coalition negotiations."

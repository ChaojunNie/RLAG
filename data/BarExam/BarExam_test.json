At 1:55 p.m. Parker, realizing he must be in Bank before it closed at 2:00 p.m., and finding no other space available, parked his automobile in front of a fire hydrant on a City street. Parker then hurried into the bank, leaving his aged neighbor, Ned, as a passenger in the rear seat of the car. About 5 minutes later, and while Parker was still in Bank, Driver was driving down the street. Driver swerved to avoid what he mistakenly thought was a hole in the street and sideswiped Parker's car. Parker's car was turned over on top of the hydrant, breaking the hydrant and causing a small flood of water. Parker's car was severely damaged and Ned was badly injured.

It was highly improbable that an injury of such a character as that sustained by appellee would have resulted. It was an extraordinary *197 occurrence and would not reasonably have been foreseen or expected by a reasonably prudent person. It is not sufficient, under the law, that the accident happened and appellee was injured. While it is very unfortunate for appellee, yet we are not warranted by the law and the evidence in holding that appellant should compensate him for the injuries sustained.

    "question": "Mrs. Ritter. a widow. recently purchased a new uncrated electric range for her kitchen from Local Retailer. The range has a wide oven with a large oven door. The crate in which Stove Company. the manufacturer. shipped the range carried a warning label that the stove would tip over with a weight of 25 pounds or more on the oven door. Mrs. Ritter has one child-Brenda. aged 3. Recently, at about 5:30 p.m.. Brenda was playing on the floor of the kitchen while Mrs. Ritter was heating water in a pan on the stove. The telephone rang and Mrs. Ritter went into the living room to answer it. While she was gone Brenda decided to find out what was cooking. She opened the oven door and climbed on it to try to see what was in the pan. Brenda's weight (25 pounds) on the door caused the stove to tip over forward. Brenda fell to the floor and the hot water spilled over her, burning her severely. Brenda screamed. Mrs. Ritter ran to the kitchen and immediately gave her first aid treatment for burns. Brenda thereafter received medical treatment. Brenda's burns were painful. They have now healed and do not bother her, but she has ugly scars on her legs and back. Brenda's claim is asserted on her behalf by the proper party. If Brenda asserts a claim based on strict liability against Local Retailer, she mustestablish that",

    "ctx": "When a retailer advertises an item for sale, it is implied that they ensure the product is safe and suitable for use. Even though a retailer may not have manufactured or distributed a defective product, they can be held liable for any injuries or losses caused by a product they sold. Similar to any personal injury case, there are specific elements that you must prove in a product liability lawsuit against a retailer. First, it must be shown that you used the product in the way that it was designed to be used and not for any other purpose. Second, it must be proven that the product was defective. Third, you must establish that you were injured and suffered losses. Lastly, you must prove that the defect in the product directly caused your injuries. Defective product claims against retailers can be challenging to prove and often require the expertise of medical and technical experts. It is always best to seek legal representation in these cases."

    "question": "Hank owned a secondhand goods store. He often placed merchandise on the sidewalk, sometimes for short intervals, sometimes from 7:00a.m. until 6:00p.m. Pedestrians from time to time stopped and gathered to look at the merchandise. Fred had moved into an apartment which was situated immediately above Hank's store; a street-level stairway entrance was located about twenty feet to the east. On several occasions, Fred had complained to Hank about the situation because not only were his view and peace of mind affected, but his travel on the sidewalk was made more difficult. Fred owned and managed a restaurant two blocks to the west of his apartment and made frequent trips back and forth. There was a back entrance to his apartment through a parking lot; this entrance was about two hundred feet farther in walking distance from his restaurant. Once Fred complained to the police, whereupon Hank was arrested under a local ordinance which prohibited the placing of goods or merchandise on public sidewalks and imposed. as its sole sanction, a fine for its violation. One day, the sidewalk in front of Hank's store was unusually cluttered because he was cleaning and mopping the floor of his shop. Fred and his fifteen-year-old son, Steve, saw a bus they wished to take, and they raced down the stairs and onto the cluttered sidewalk in front of Hank's store, Fred in the lead. While dodging merchandise and people, Fred fell. Steve tripped over him and suffered a broken arm. Fred also suffered broken bones and was unable to attend to his duties for six weeks. If prior to the day of his personal injuries, Fred had asserted a claim based on public nuisance for injunctive relief against Hank for his obstruction of the sidewalk in violation of the ordinance, the defense on which Hank would have most likely prevailed is that",

Rule 9(g) of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure requires that “when items of special damage are claimed, they shall be specifically stated.” Special damages must be pleaded with enough specificity “that the opposing party has an adequate opportunity to defend against the plaintiff's claims.” Hodges, 811 P.2d at 162.  However, the plaintiff need not plead a specific dollar amount, and our supreme court has held that a complaint seeking “damages for lost wages ... and severe emotional distress” has sufficiently pleaded special damages.

After substantial public discussion, the Board of Bar Governors, by a close vote, fails to pass such a resolution. These events receive extensive coverage in the local newspapers.

    "ctx": "Every crime has a set of elements that the prosecuting attorney must prove in order to establish the defendant's guilt. One of these elements typically has to do with the defendant's mental state. Usually, prosecutors must show that the defendant acted intentionally or knowingly. But, with strict liability crimes, the prosecution doesn't need to prove that a defendant intended to do something that's illegal. The prosecution doesn't even need to establish that the defendant was reckless or negligent. It's enough for a conviction to prove that the act was committed and the defendant committed it.\n\nWhy Have Strict Liability Crimes?\n\"Strict liability\" is a concept mainly applicable to civil law. It's a way of holding someone accountable for behavior regardless of fault (such as in product liability cases). Because criminal punishment is usually reserved for those who act with a culpable (guilty) mental state, strict liability crimes are rare. But some acts produce outcomes that lawmakers want to criminally punish regardless of a defendant's state of mind.\n\nWhat Are Common Strict Liability Offenses?\nProbably the most well-known example of a strict liability crime is statutory rape. Most states make it a crime to have sex with a minor, even if the defendant honestly and reasonably believed that the sexual partner was old enough to give legal consent.\n\nSelling alcohol to a minor is another strict liability crime. In some states, a conviction is appropriate even if the seller honestly thought the buyer was 21 or older and tried to confirm as much.\n\nSome traffic offenses are strict liability crimes. In many places, it doesn't matter whether a driver knowingly went over the speed limit—the plain act of speeding typically justifies a conviction."

    "ctx": "Such relationships (those that impose a duty of care) may arise by operation of law (e.g. master-servant), by agreement, or may be imposed by law in particular fact circumstances. Each of these relationships involves the essential determination as a matter of policy that the claimed supervisor has some duty of care either to protect the one to be supervised from injury or to protect third persons from injuries caused by the one to be supervised. In some instances, as with children, the duty may be to protect the supervised individual from self-imposed injury. E.g., Rogger v. Voyles, 797 S.W.2d 844, 846 (Mo.App.1990)(13 year-old child drove automobile and lost control). In other instances, the duty may be to protect against harm to the child by instrumentalities or conditions of land or personal property. See Smith v. Archbishop of St. Louis, 632 S.W.2d 516, 518–19 (Mo.App.1982)(child injured when costume set afire by burning candle on teacher's desk). Finally the duty may be to protect the child under supervision against harm by third persons (whether negligent or intentional).  In each of these situations involving children, policy and decisional law has established that “acceptance of the custody and control of a minor child creates a relationship sufficient to support a duty of care.” A.R.H. v. W.H.S., 876 S.W.2d 687, 691 (Mo.App.1994). The duty imposed is to supervise the minor child. Id. at 689.

Stoven later mortgaged Craigmont to Martin to secure a loan of $50,000. The mortgage was promptly and properly recorded. Subsequently, Stoven conveyed Craigmont to Fritsch. About a year later, Fritsch borrowed $100,000 from Zom, an elderly widow, and gave her a mortgage on Craigmont to secure repayment of the loan. Zorn did not know about the mortgage held by Martin. The understanding between Fritsch and Zorn was that Fritsch would use the $100,000 to pay off the mortgage held by Ulrich and that Zom would, therefore, have a first mortgage on Craigmont. Zorn's mortgage was promptly and properly recorded. Fritsch paid the $100,000 received from Zom to Ulrich and obtained and recorded a release of the Ulrich mortgage. The $50,000 debt secured by the Martin mortgage was not paid when it was due, and Martin brought an appropriate action to foreclose, joining Stoven, Fritsch, and Zom as defendants and alleging that Martin's mortgage was senior to Zorn's mortgage on Craigmont.

Gennybelle used Mural's $14,000 figure in preparing and submitting her own sealed bid on Doctors' Building. Before the bids were opened, Mural truthfully advised Gennybelle that the former's telegraphic sub-bid had been based on a $4,000 computational error and was therefore revoked. Shortly thereafter, Gennybelle was awarded the Doctors' Building construction contract and subsequently contracted with another paperhanger for a price of $18,000. Gennybelle now sues Mural to recover $4,000. Which of the following, if proved, would best support Mural's defense?",

If this contention, never made until 1957 after the school building was completed, had been advanced in 1955, the school district could perhaps have avoided any risk of improper procedure. Instead, Ahern in its letter merely asserted that it had made an error in computation. The practical effect of Ahern's repudiation of its bid has been to increase, in an amount exceeding Ahern's deposit, the school district's costs in performing a contract which no person entitled to do so has questioned, by forcing employment of the next lowest painting sub-bidder."

It goes hand in hand with the concepts of “consideration” and the “illusory promise” (which is basically an empty promise: promising to do one thing while, at the same time, expressly retaining the right to change one's mind). See id. at 316; 1 Samuel Williston, Contracts § 43, at 140 (3d ed.1957); 2 Arthur L. Corbin, Corbin on Contracts § 6.1 (Joseph M. Perillo, et al., eds., rev. ed.1995). Discussion of mutuality of obligations generally only arises in the context of a bilateral contract, where two parties bind themselves to an agreement by each promising to do one thing in exchange for the other's promise to do another thing. See Helle v. Landmark, Inc., 15 Ohio App.3d 1, 472 N.E.2d 765, 776 (1984) (“Stripped to its essence, the concept of ‘mutuality of obligation’ expresses the idea that ‘both parties to the contract must be bound or neither is bound.’ However, this formulation applies only to an analysis of bilateral contracts, in which reciprocal promises are exchanged.”);  Corbin on Contracts, supra, § 6.1, at 203–04. Thus, to say a contract lacks mutuality of obligation is to say only that one party has failed to actually promise to do the thing he said he would do, or, stated yet a third way, has failed to give consideration."

The limitation on expression must be designed carefully to achieve the State's goal. Compliance with this requirement may be measured by two criteria. First, the restriction must directly advance the state interest involved; the regulation may not be sustained if it provides only ineffective or remote support for the government's purpose. Second, if the governmental interest could be served as well by a more limited restriction on commercial speech, the excessive restrictions cannot survive."

    "question": "The state of Brunswick enacted a statute providing for the closure of the official state records of arrest and prosecution of all persons acquitted of a crime by a court or against whom criminal charges were filed and subsequently dropped or dismissed. The purpose of this statute is to protect these persons from further publicity or embarrassment relating to those state proceedings. However, this statute does not prohibit the publication of such information that is in the possession of private persons. A prominent businessman in Neosho City in Brunswick was arrested and charged with rape. Prior to trial, the prosecutor announced that new information indicated that the charges should be dropped. He then dropped the charges without further explanation, and the records relating thereto were closed to the public pursuant to the Brunswick statute. The Neosho City Times conducted an investigation to determine why the businessman was not prosecuted, but was refused access to the closed official state records. In an effort to determine whether the law enforcement agencies involved were properly doing their duty, the Times filed suit against appropriate state officials to force opening of the records and to invalidate the statute on constitutional grounds.

The State relied on the transferred intent doctrine to prove Seba acted intentionally and with premeditation.\nThis court has previously explained the transferred intent doctrine by stating:\n“The fact that the homicidal act was directed against one other than the person killed does not relieve the slayer of criminal responsibility. It is generally held that such a homicide partakes of the quality of the original act, so that the guilt of the perpetrator of the crime is exactly what it would have been had the assault followed upon the intended victim instead of another.” State v.

Content-neutral regulations are reviewed under intermediate scrutiny, which is easier to satisfy than strict scrutiny.\nIntermediate scrutiny allows reasonable and content-neutral time, place, or manner regulations (Lebron v. Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. (Amtrak), 69 F.3d 650, 655 (2d Cir. 1995)). Under intermediate scrutiny, the government must prove that:\nIt has a significant governmental interest.\nThe regulation is narrowly tailored to serve the significant interest. The tailoring does not need to be the least restrictive nor the least intrusive possible.\nThe regulation leaves open ample alternatives for communication."

    "question": "John is a licensed barber in State A. The State A barber licensing statute provides that the Barber Licensing Board may revoke a barber license if it finds that a licensee has used his or her business premises for an illegal purpose. John was arrested by federal narcotics enforcement agents on a charge of selling cocaine in his barbershop in violation of federal laws. However, the local United States Attorney declined to prosecute and the charges were dropped. Nevertheless, the Barber Licensing Board commenced a proceeding against John to revoke his license on the ground that John used his business premises for illegal sales of cocaine. At a subsequent hearing before the board, the only evidence against John was affidavits by unnamed informants, who were not present or available for cross-examination. Their affidavits stated that they purchased cocaine from John in his barbershop. Based solely on this evidence, the board found that John used his business premises for an illegal purpose and ordered his license revoked. In a suit by John to have this revocation set aside, his best constitutional argument is that",

McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 557-558, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 2975-2976, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974). See, e. g. Phillips v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 283 U.S. 589, 596-597, 51 S.Ct. 608, 611-612, 75 L.Ed. 1289 (1931). See also Dent v. West Virginia, 129 U.S. 114, 124-125, 9 S.Ct. 231, 234, 32 L.Ed. 623 (1889). The “right to be heard before being condemned to suffer grievous loss of any kind, even though it may not involve the stigma and hardships of a criminal conviction, is a principle basic to our society.” Joint Anti-Fascist Comm. v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123, 168, 71 S.Ct. 624, 646, 95 L.Ed. 817 (1951) (Frankfurter, J., concurring). The fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard “at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.” Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 U.S. 545, 552, 85 S.Ct. 1187, 1191, 14 L.Ed.2d 62 (1965). See Grannis v. Ordean, 234 U.S. 385, 394, 34 S.Ct. 779, 783, 58 L.Ed. 1363 (1914).\n\nThese decisions underscore the truism that “ ‘(d)ue process,’ unlike some legal rules, is not a technical conception with a fixed content unrelated to time, place and circumstances.” Cafeteria Workers v. McElroy, 367 U.S. 886, 895, 81 S.Ct. 1743, 1748, 6 L.Ed.2d 1230 (1961).  “(D)ue process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.” Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 481, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 2600, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972). Accordingly, resolution of the issue whether the administrative procedures provided here are constitutionally sufficient requires analysis of the governmental and private interests that are affected. Arnett v. Kennedy, supra, 416 U.S., at 167-168, 94 S.Ct., at 1650-1651 (Powell, J., concurring in part); Goldberg v. Kelly, supra, 397 U.S., at 263-266, 90 S.Ct., at 1018-1020; **903 Cafeteria Workers v. McElroy, supra, 367 U.S., at 895, 81 S.Ct., at 1748-1749. More precisely, our prior decisions *335 indicate that identification of the specific dictates of due process generally requires consideration of three distinct factors: First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government's interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail. See, e. g., Goldberg v. Kelly, supra, 397 U.S., at 263-271, 90 S.Ct., at 1018-1022."

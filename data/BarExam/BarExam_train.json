    "question": "Diner, a drive-in hamburger and ice cream stand, recently opened for business in the suburban town of Little City. Diner's business hours are from 9:00 a.m. to midnight. It is in an area that for fifteen years has been zoned for small retail businesses, apartment buildings, and one- and two-family residences. The zoning code specifies that \"small retail businesses\" include \"businesses where food and drink are dispensed for consumption on the premises.\" Diner was the first drive-in in Little City. For seven years Mr. and Mrs. Householder have owned and lived in their single-family residence, which is across the street from Diner. On opening day a brass band played in the parking lot of Diner until midnight, and the noise of cars and the unusual activity as a result of the new business prevented the Householders from getting to sleep until well after midnight, long after their usual time. Diner is heavily patronized during the day and night by high school students. The noise of cars, the lights of the cars, the lights illuminating the parking lot at Diner, and the noise from the loudspeaker of the ordering system prevented the Householders from sleeping before midnight. Paper cups, napkins, and other items from the drive-in are regularly blown into the Householders' front yard by the prevailing wind. The traffic to and from Diner is so heavy on the street in front of their house that the Householders are afraid to allow their small children to play in the front yard. The Householders have asserted a claim against Diner based on private nuisance. The most likely effect of the fact that Householders were in the area before Diner is that it",

    "ctx": "Nuisance Defenses\nThere are several defenses available to those accused of creating a nuisance. One important defense is called ‘coming to the nuisance’. It applies when the harmful activity was operating before the plaintiffs acquired the property impacted by the nuisance. If the owners were aware of the nuisance-creating activity at the time they purchased the property, the defendant may invoke the defense of ‘coming to the nuisance’. This defense effectively argues that the plaintiffs knew what they were getting themselves into and assumed the risk of harm. While in the past, ‘coming to the nuisance’ was considered an absolute defense, today it is a factor that the courts will consider in determining whether the plaintiffs may recover for nuisance.[4] An example of this manifested in Foster v. Preston Mill Co.,[5] wherein blasting from a nearby timber farm caused minks to panic and attack each other. As the farm existed before the ranch housing the minks, there was no liability for nuisance."

When he died on April 1, 1948, he was the absolute owner of the land in question, because of the invalidity of his former deed of conveyance thereof without the signature of his wife, and, therefore, the rights of the complainants in the present case had intervented long prior to her signing and acknowledging the deed. This fact distinguishes Howell v. Hill from the case at bar. Even though the wife of John Brassel may have been willing that the homestead be sold on October 24, 1942, the time at which the contemporaneous assent of the husband and wife must exist is the time when the deed is finally executed by her joinder therein. In other words, the deed is void as to the owner of the homestead who has executed a deed to the same until the other spouse joins therein with the contemporaneous assent of both.  Consequently, there can be no joinder by the wife in the execution of a conveyance of the homestead by the husband unless she executes the conveyance during his lifetime, and with his consent."

    "ctx": "A scheme by which an owner of a defined area of land divides it up into a number of separate lots for sale (or lease) and imposes on the purchasers (or lessors) restrictions as to the use and development of the land by means of uniform covenants restricting the use to which the grantees may put the lots, with the express intention that the area as a whole, and each and every lot, will benefit thereby. For example, a scheme that restricts the development of each lot to a single-family residence and requires that all buildings are to be erected and maintained in general conformity with a set of rules that are imposed on all purchasers. A scheme of development establishes a form of 'local law' by which the development and management of the land is controlled for the benefit of all the purchasers and their successors. The essential aim of the scheme is that each purchaser will have the benefit of the same restrictions as those to which he has been subjected (Besch v. Hyman, 221 App Div 455, 223 NYS 233 (1927); Snow v. Van Dam, 291 Mass 477, 197 N.E. 224 (1935); Re Dolphin's Conveyance [1970] Ch 654, 662, [1970] 2 All ER 664; Brunner v Greenslade [1971] Ch 993, 1003, [1970] 3 All ER 836; Texaco Antilles Ltd v Kernochan [1973] AC 609, [1973] 2 All ER 118 (PC)).\nIn order to be able to enforce the provisions of a scheme of development each purchaser of an area of land (or his successor), as well as the common vendor, must have a right to enforce the restrictions for his own benefit (technically by suing for breach of a negative or restrictive covenant), and by the same token, must accept the burdens imposed on his use of the land. Thus, \"reciprocity is the foundation of the idea of a scheme … [and a purchaser] must know both the extent of his burden and the extent of his benefit\", Reid v Bickerstaff [1909] 2 Ch 305, 319, [1908-10] All ER Rep 298 (CA) (Re Palmer v Reesor (1914) 6 OWN 622, 624 (Can)) (in the US called the 'doctrine of reciprocal negative easement'). The reciprocal benefits and burdens are referred to as 'equitable servitudes' (as they are rights originating from the English Court of Equity—Tulk v Moxhay (1848) 2 Ph 774, 41 Eng Rep 1143) (Trustees of Columbia College v. Lynch, 70 NY 440 (1877); Allen v. Detroit, 167 Mich 464, 133 N.W. 317, 319 (1911); Weigman v. Kusel, 270 Ill 520, 110 N.E. 884 (1915)).\nIn common law, as a rule, a scheme of development requires five conditions to be satisfied for there to be the 'mutuality of enforcement', that is an essential element of the scheme: (i) the area to which the scheme applies must be clearly defined (Reid v Bickerstaff, supra; Whitgift Homes Ltd v Stocks [2001] EWCA Civ 1732, [2001] 48 EG 130 (CA)); (ii) any of the parties seeking to enforce the scheme must have derived title to the land from a common vendor (or from a successor in title who is bound in equity to the common vendor); (iii) that prior to selling the land the common vendor must have laid out the area for sale in lots with the intention that the restrictions, drawn up in accordance with a common plan, would be imposed on the use and development of all the plots; (iv) each purchaser must have accepted the restrictions on the understanding that similar restrictions would be imposed on each and every purchaser of any one of the lots; and (v) the restrictions must be intended by the vendor to be, and are, imposed for the benefit of each and every plot (although the restrictions imposed on each plot need not be identical: Elliston v Reacher [1909] 2 Ch 384; Allen v Veranne Builders Ltd [1988] NPC 11; Sanborn v. McLean, 233 Mich 227, 206 N.W. 496, 60 ALR 1212 (1925); Anno: 4 ALR2d 1364, 1369: General Plan of Subdivision—Notice; Cash v. Granite Springs Retreat Ass'n, Inc., 2011 WY 25, 248 P.3d 614 (WYO 2011)). However, a scheme of development is likely to bind any owner of land on the estate where: (i) it is clear that the common vendor's intention was to impose substantially the same restrictions on all the plots in the defined area; (ii) the purchasers acquired their plots on the understanding that the 'laws' of the estate would be binding on them and would benefit the entire estate; and (iii) it was intended that the purchasers would have reciprocal rights to enforce the law against the other owners (Re Wembley Park Estate Co Ltd's Transfer [1968] Ch 491, [1968] 1 All ER 457; Eagling v Gardner [1970] 2 All ER 838; The American Law Institute, Restatement of Property (St. Paul, MN: 1944), § 541; Wichmeyer v. Finch, 231 Ind 282, 107 N.E.2d 661, 665 (1952); Cf. Steinmann v. Silverman, 14 NY.2d 243, 251 NYS.2d 1, 200 N.E.2d 192 (1964) where there was no \"common scheme\" with respect to the covenants). \"The material thing I [Greene M.R.] think is that every purchaser … must know when he buys what are the regulations to which he is subjecting himself, and what are the regulations to which other purchasers on the estate will be called upon to subject themselves\", White v Bijou Mansions Ltd [1938] Ch 351, 361, [1938] 1 All ER 546 (CA).

To what extent is an expert witness’s basis for an opinion admissible, and to what extent is it hearsay?\nWhile various state courts differ as to the details of this question, some general guidelines can help attorneys begin to explore questions of hearsay in expert witness testimony.\nUnderstanding Hearsay in the Expert Witness Context\nFederal Rule of Evidence 703 allows an expert witness to “base an opinion on facts or data in the case that the expert has been made aware of or personally observed.”\nRule 703 goes on to explain that if the facts or data are the type that experts in the same field would reasonably rely on to form similar opinions, the facts or data do not have to be admissible in order for the witness’s opinion to be admissible. However, inadmissible facts or data may be disclosed to the jury “only if their probative value in helping the jury evaluate the opinion substantially outweighs their prejudicial effect.”\nRule 703 raises several issues worth considering when evaluating expert witness testimony for hearsay."

    "question": "Neff and Owens owned adjoining residences in Smithville. In 1971, they hired a contractor to lay sidewalks in front of both of their homes. Each man was to pay the contractor for that part of the work attributable to his property. After he had paid the bill which the contractor had submitted to him, Neff became convinced that the contractor had erred and had charged him for labor and materials which were used for part of the sidewalk in front of Owens' property. Neff thereupon asked Owens to reimburse him for the amount which he assumed he had erroneously paid the contractor. After a lengthy discussion, and although he was still convinced that he owed Neff nothing, Owens finally said: \"I want to avoid trouble, and so if you agree not to sue for reimbursement, I'll employ a caretaker for a three-year term to keep our sidewalks free of ice and snow.\" Neff orally assented.

Whether this defense can be effectively asserted will depend largely on whether the person involved has made him or herself - in a temporary newsworthy capacity or a more permanent celebrity capacity - something of a public figure. In such cases, details of their private lives are more likely to be considered items of legitimate public interest. The passage of time may lessen the public interest in a given fact (the newsworthiness of it), which may weaken this defense.\nConsent\nConsent is a total defense. If the plaintiff has consented in some way to the disclosure, whether through a release form or through accepting an interview, then he or she cannot pursue a claim for public disclosure of private fact.\nPublic Record\nMatters of public record, such as birth date, military service records, and others, are exempted. The defendant may claim this defense by showing that the disclosed fact was actually a matter of public record. However, it should be noted that, unlike defamation actions, truth is no defense to a claim for public disclosure of private facts. This means that a defendant cannot refute a claim by showing that the disclosed fact was actually true or accurate."

It also requires the witness to identify “with particularity” the material relied on to establish familiarity with the person's handwriting.\nThe Eleventh Circuit agreed with the district court that the plaintiff's affidavit did not provide a foundation for her asserted familiarity with the insured's handwriting.

This accident caused her to suffer severe pain and to incur medical expenses of $700. Susie brought two claims for damages: one against Roger's Market and the other against West Beef Company.

We think that the case was rightly submitted to the jury and we discover no error in regard to the instructions that were given or refused.\n1. As to the plaintiff's due care. The plaintiff was where he had a right to be and was engaged in the performance of his duty, and whether he should have seen and guarded against the danger of a collision and have exercised more supervision over the motorman, and whether, taking all of the circumstances into account, he was in the exercise of due care was plainly for the jury.\n2. As to the negligence of the motorman. We assume in the defendant's favor that if the motorman's negligence caused or contributed to the collision the plaintiff cannot recover. Yarnold v. Bowers, 186 Mass. 396, 71 N. E. 799; Allyn v. B. & M. R. R., 105 Mass. 77. The instructions on this point were, to say the least, sufficiently favorable to the defendant. We do not see how it could have been ruled as matter of law that the motorman was negligent.  The question of due care or negligence is ordinarily one for the jury. When the facts are undisputed it becomes one of law. In this case it was for the jury to determine what the facts were and then decide whether they showed that the motorman was or was not negligent. Whether he should have discovered the plight of the automobile before he did and whether he exercised proper care in the way in which he operated the car after he did discover it were clearly questions for the jury.\n3. As to the defendant's negligence. There was testimony which, if believed, tended to show that the accident was due to failure on the defendant's part to use the emergency brake, in other words to what might be found to be negligence in the manner in which he operated the car. It was for the jury to give such weight as they saw fit to his testimony and explanation in relation thereto.  It was also for them to say whether he exercised due care in turning into Leyford Terrace as he did and whether if he did not such want of due care on his part contributed to the accident. The question of defendant's negligence like that of the plaintiff's and motorman's due care was for the jury. It could not be ruled as matter of law that there was no evidence of negligence on his part.\n"

A title is a bundle of rights in a piece of property in which a party may own either a legal interest or equitable interest. “Bundle of rights” is the term for the set of legal privileges that is generally afforded to a real estate buyer and covers all the things they can and can't do with the property as its owner.\nIn terms of chain of title, all of these documents work together. For example, a mistake in the recording of the deed could lead to huge problems with the chain of title because in most cases the person who has a properly recorded deed will prevail over one who claims the property without one."

Accordingly, First wrote into their contract his promise to Victim \"to pay from any settlementtwith Driver compensation to any physician who provides professional services for Victim's injuries.\" The contract also provided that First's duties were \"'nonassignable.\" First immediately filed suit against Driver. Victim then sought and received medical treatment, reasonably valued at S1,000, from Doctor, but failed to inform Doctor of First's promise. After receiving a bill from Doctor for $1,000, Victim immediately wrote Doctor explaining that he was unable to pay and enclosing a copy of his contract with First. Victim then asked First about payment of this bill, but First requested a release from their employment contract. stating that he would like to refer Victim's claim to attorney Second and that Second was willing to represent Victim in the pending lawsuit. Victim wrote a letter to First releasing him from their contract and agreeing to Second's representation. A copy of this letter was sent to Doctor. Second subsequently promised First to represent Victim and soon negotiated a settlement of Victim's claim against Driver which netted $1,000, all of which was paid by Victim to creditors other than Doctor.

While donee beneficiaries stand to benefit from the fulfillment of a contract, they are not technically party to the contract.\nWho Is a Donee Beneficiary?\nThe donee beneficiary’s relationship to the parties in the contract distinguishes them from other types of third-party beneficiaries. Namely, a donee beneficiary’s claim to benefit from the contract amounts to a gift from one of the contractual parties. Donee beneficiaries are also allowed to include their promised property or estate into their own estate, as in the case of a 5 by 5 Power in Trust.\nAs with other situations involving third-party beneficiaries, donee beneficiaries have the legal right to demand benefits promised to them once their rights to the contract have vested. This makes them separate from creditor beneficiaries, who can only file suits once they have been made aware of the contracts or intended benefits. However, donee beneficiaries can only claim legal rights after the contract has been executed, per specified criteria."

    "ctx": "Any kind of contract may be considered broken (\"breached\") once one party unconditionally refuses to perform under the contract as promised, regardless of when performance is supposed to take place. This unconditional refusal is known as a \"repudiation\" of a contract.\nOnce one party to a contract indicates--either through words or actions--that it's not going to perform its contract obligations, the other party can immediately claim a breach of contract (failure to perform under the contract) and seek remedies such as payment. This is sometimes called an anticipatory breach of contract. Read on to learn more about the concepts of repudiation and anticipatory breach of contract. \nWhen Does Repudiation Occur?\nCourts usually recognize three types of repudiation when it comes to contract law:\nA positive and unconditional refusal is made to the other party (\"express repudiation\"). The other party must tell you, in essence, \"I'm not going through with the deal.\" It's not enough to make a qualified or ambiguous refusal. (For example, \"Unless this drought breaks, I won't be able to deliver the apples.\") The repudiation must be clear, straightforward, and directed at the other party. (For example, \"I will not be delivering the apples as promised.\")\nAn action makes it impossible for the other party to perform. When it comes to repudiation, actions speak as loudly as words. For example, let's say a couple was supposed to repay two loans from the profits of their business. Instead, the couple ran the business into the ground, incurring lots of other debts and making it impossible to pay back their original loans. Their reckless, voluntary actions counted as a repudiation of the original loan agreements.\nThe property that is the subject of the deal is transferred to someone else. If the contract is for the sale of property, repudiation occurs when one party transfers (or makes a deal to transfer) the property to a third party. For example, if you've contracted to buy a house and you learn that the other party has subsequently sold it to his brother, your sales contract has been repudiated (even if you never heard a word about it from the other party)"

    "question": "Customer. aged twenty, went into Store at approximately 6:45 p.m. to look at some suits that were on sale. The clerks were busy, and one of them told him that he should wait on himself. Customer selected three suits from a rack and went into the dressing room to try them on. Signs posted on the walls of Store state that closing time is 9:00 p.m.; however, because of a special awards banquet for employees, Store was closed at 7:00 p.m. on this day. The employees, in a hurry to get to the banquet. did not check the dressing rooms or turn off the lights before leaving. When Customer emerged from the dressing room a few minutes after 7:00 p.m., he was alone and locked in. Customer tried the front door, but it was secured on the outside by a bar and padlock, so he went to the rear door. Customer grabbed the door knob and vigorously shook the door. It did not open, but the activity setoff a mechanism that had been installed because of several recent thefts committed by persons who had hidden in the store until after closing time. The mechanism sprayed a chemical mist in Customer's face, causing him to become temporarily blind. The mechanism also activated an alarm carried by Store's employee, Watchman, who was just coming to work. Watchman unlocked the front door, ran into the store. and grabbed Customer. Customer, who was still unable to see, struck out at this person and hit a metal rack, injuring his hand. Watchman then identified himself, and Customer did the same. After assuring himself that Customer was telling the truth, Watchman allowed him to leave. if Customer is to prevail on a claim against Store based on battery from the use of the chemical spray.

    "ctx": "a. Common law action of trespass for battery. Except in one particular, the conditions stated in this Section as necessary to make the actor liable are the same as those necessary to make a defendant liable under strict common law pleading in an action of trespass for battery. Under the rule stated in this Section, the actor's liability includes liability for offensive contacts which are intentionally caused, irrespective of whether they result directly or indirectly from the other's conduct, while the common law action of trespass for battery required the offensive contact to result directly from the actor's conduct.\nb. In order that one may be liable under the rule stated in this Section, he must have done an act as that word is defined in § 2. Therefore, if a third person takes hold of the defendant's hand and with it slaps another's face, the only act is that of the third person. The defendant's hand is used merely as an instrument by which the third person accomplishes his purpose and, therefore, the third person rather than the defendant is liable for the offensive contact caused by the use of the latter's hand.\nc. Meaning of “contact with another's person.” In order to make the actor liable under the rule stated in this Section, it is not necessary that he should bring any part of his own body in contact with another's person. It is enough that he intentionally cause his clothing or anything held or attached to him to come into such contact. So too, he is liable under the rule stated in this Section if he throws a substance, such as water, upon the other or if he sets a dog upon him. It is not necessary that the contact with the other's person be directly caused by some act of the actor. All that is necessary is that the actor intend to cause the other, directly or indirectly, to come in contact with a foreign substance in a manner which the other will reasonably regard as offensive. Thus, if the actor daubs with filth a towel which he expects another to use in wiping his face with the expectation that the other will smear his face with it and the other does so, the actor is liable as fully as though he had directly thrown the filth in the other's face or had otherwise smeared his face with it. So too, if the actor at a dignified social function, and for the purpose of making another appear ridiculous, pulls from under him a chair upon which he is about to sit, the actor is liable to the other under the rule stated in this Section."

    "ctx": "An assignment is the transfer of rights held by one party called the “assignor” to another party called the “assignee.” The legal nature of the assignment and the contractual terms of the agreement between the parties determines some additional rights and liabilities that accompany the assignment. The assignment of rights under a contract usually completely transfers the rights to the assignee to receive the benefits accruing under the contract. Ordinarily, the term assignment is limited to the transfer of rights that are intangible, like contractual rights and rights connected with property. Merchants Service Co. v. Small Claims Court, 35 Cal. 2d 109, 113-114 (Cal. 1950). An assignment will generally be permitted under the law unless there is an express prohibition against assignment in the underlying contract or lease. Where assignments are permitted, the assignor need not consult the other party to the contract but may merely assign the rights at that time. However, an assignment cannot have any adverse effect on the duties of the other party to the contract, nor can it diminish the chance of the other party receiving complete performance. The assignor normally remains liable unless there is an agreement to the contrary by the other party to the contract. The effect of a valid assignment is to remove privity between the assignor and the obligor and create privity between the obligor and the assignee. Privity is usually defined as a direct and immediate contractual relationship. See Merchants case above. Further, for the assignment to be effective in most jurisdictions, it must occur in the present. One does not normally assign a future right; the assignment vests immediate rights and obligations. No specific language is required to create an assignment so long as the assignor makes clear his/her intent to assign identified contractual rights to the assignee. Since expensive litigation can erupt from ambiguous or vague language, obtaining the correct verbiage is vital. An agreement must manifest the intent to transfer rights and can either be oral or in writing and the rights assigned must be certain."

    "question": "Farquart had made a legally binding promise to furnish his son Junior and the latter's fiancee a house on their wedding day, planned for June 10, 1972. Pursuant to that promise, Farquart telephoned his old contractor-friend Sawtooth on May 1, 1971, and made the following oral agreementeach making full and accurate written notes thereof: Sawtooth was to cut 30 trees into fireplace logs from a specified portion of a certain one-acre plot owned by Farquart, and Farquart was to pay therefor S20 per tree. Sawtooth agreed further to build a house ,n the plot conforming to the specifications of Plan OP5 published by Builders, Inc. for a construction price of Sl8,000. Farquart agreed to make payments of $2,000 on the first of every month for nine months beginning August I, 1971, upon monthly presentation of a certificate by Builders. Inc. that the specifications of Plan OP5 were being met. Sawtooth delivered the cut logs to Farquart in July 1971, when he also began building the house. Farquart made three S2.,000 payments forthe work done in July, August, and September 1971, without requiring a certificate. Sawtooth worked through October, but no work was done from November 1, 1971. to the end of February 1972. because of bad weather: and Farquart made no payments during that period. Sawtooth did not object. On March 1, 1972, Sawtooth demanded payment of $2,000 but Farquart refused on the grounds that no construction work had been done for four months and Builders had issued no certificate. Sawtooth thereupon abandoned work and repudiated the agreement. What was the probable legal effect of the following? I.

Construction Company did not place any barriers around the trench and permitted it to lie open for almost a week while waiting for the delivery of water pipes.

Doctor's garage was on the street level, with a driveway entrance from the street. At two in the morning Doctor received an emergency call. She dressed and went to the garage to get her car and found a car parked in front of her driveway. That car was occupied by Parker, who, while intoxicated, had driven to that place and now was in a drunken stupor in the front seat.

Doctor released the brake and coasted the car down the street, planning to pull into a parking space that was open. When Doctor attempted to stop the car, the brakes failed to work, and the car crashed into the wall of Owner's home, damaging Owner's home and Parker's car and injuring Doctor and Parker. Subsequent examination of the car disclosed that the brake linings were badly worn. A state statute prohibits the operation of a motor vehicle unless the brakes are capable of stopping the vehicle within specified distances at specified speeds.

Or, Congress may direct an entity to be self sufficient, but leave open the possibility that appropriations may be applied. See, e.g., L'Enfant Plaza, 668 F.2d at 1212 (financial self-sufficiency does not establish NAFI where historically appropriations were received and are allowed under the statute for the future); Slattery v. United States, 53 Fed.Cl. 258 (Fed.Cl.2002) (FDIC Bank Insurance Fund is not a NAFI because Congress expressed willingness to appropriate funds, although it never has). Whether an agency or agency fund is a NAFI is determined by looking at the entirety of its financial wellspring, not by parsing its revenue stream to determine which moneys came from the Treasury and which from customer payments. Indeed, an entity is not treated as a NAFI even if all of its money flows from its own activities, and even if appropriated funds have never been used, so long as “under the agency's authorizing legislation Congress could appropriate *410 funds if necessary.”"

The creation of an express easement is governed by contract law. In contrast to express easements, implied easements can arise over time as a result of circumstances that exist between the parties and the property. Easements are generally affirmative in nature- thus, they confer the right to use the servient land in some specific manner.\nCovenants. Covenants are written agreements in which the grantor promises to take or not take a certain action with respect to the land. Some covenants attach to the land and are applicable to all subsequent owners of the property. For such covenants to be enforceable, the covenant must be in writing and the new owner must receive adequate notification of the covenant. Other covenants expire when the property is transferred. Covenants typically exist in common interest developments, such as homeowners associations, to promote consistency in the appearance and operation of the development. Covenants of this nature are generally negative such that they restrict the actions and behavior of the consenting party with respect to his property. For example, in a homeowner’s association, members are subject to covenants that prohibit them from using certain paint colors or having pets in the home.\nLicenses. A license grants permission to a third party to use the property for a specific purpose.  Unlike an easement, the license granted to the licensee may be revoked at the discretion of the licensor unless the license is set forth in a written contract with a specified termination date. The exception to this rule exists when a licensee makes significant expenditures in reliance on the use granted by the license. In such a case, the license resembles an easement more than a license and can be deemed irrevocable."

If no such person is identifiable, then the remainder is subject to a condition precedent and is a contingent remainder. In determining the type of remainder created, Georgia has consistently followed two common law principles: (a) the law favors construing “conditions to be subsequent” and (b) the law favors the “vesting of remainders in all cases of doubt,” which is also called the “early vesting” of remainders. Professor Chaffin has noted that “[a]lthough it is possible to create nondescendible defeasible remainders by using very clear conditions of survivorship by way of condition subsequent, it is difficult to do so in view of the preference for defeasibly vested rather than contingent interests.”"

    "question": "Mrs. Dennis' 12-year-old daughter, Gala, had some difficulty getting along with other children in the neighborhood, especially with the younger ones. Thinking the experience would be good for her. Mrs. Dennis recommended Gala to Mr. Parrent as a baby-sitter for his five-year-old boy, Robby, but did not mention Gala's difficulties or her lack of prior experience as a babysitter. The Dennises and the Parrents were longstanding social acquaintances. On the evening Gala was to sit, the Parrents told Gala that she should treat Robby firmly, but that it would be preferable not to spank him since he did not take kindly to it. They did not tell Gala they had experienced trouble retaining baby-sitters because of Robby's temper tantrums. Later in the evening when Robby became angry upon being told to go to his room for being naughty. Gala spanked him, but only moderately hard. Robby then threw a hardbacked book at Gala, hitting her in the eye. As Gala tried to catch Robby to take him to his room, Robby fled around the house and out the back door, knocking over and breaking an expensive lamp. The back yard was completely dark. Gala heard Robby screaming and banging at the back door, which had closed and locked automatically, but she did nothing. After twenty minutes had passed, she heard a banging and crying at the front door, but still she did nothing. Then the noise stopped. In a few minutes Gala went outside and found Robby lying on the steps unconscious and injured. If a claim is asserted on behalf of Robby against Mrs. Dennis for damages based on Gala's conduct, Mrs. Dennis will probably be liable. because",

One of the contract provisions was that after the closing Homer had the right to remain in residence at Blackacre for up to 30 days before delivering possession to Purcell. The closing took place as scheduled. Title passed to Purcell and Homer remained in possession. Within a few days after the closing, the new house next door which was being constructed for Homer was burned to the ground, and at the end of the 30-day period Homer refused to move out of Blackacre; instead, Homer tendered to Purcell a monthly rental payment in excess of the fair rental value of Blackacre. Purcell rejected the proposal and that day brought an appropriate action to gain immediate possession of Blackacre. The contract was silent as to the consequences of Homer 's failure to give up possession within the 30-day period, and the jurisdiction in which Blackacre is located has no statute dealing directly with this situation, although the landlord-tenant law of the jurisdiction requires a landlord to give a tenant 30 days notice before a tenant may be evicted.

For example, fencing a road in a manner suitable for a highway and permitting the public to use it might constitute a dedication. Recording a plan and conveying lots in accordance with the plan, without any indication otherwise, also likely constitutes an intent to dedicate the streets shown on the plan to public use. Recording a plan and conveying lots in accordance with the plan, without any indication otherwise, also likely constitutes an intent to dedicate the streets shown on the plan to public use. On the other hand, granting the public a license to use a way for a limited period of time likely does not amount to a dedication. In addition, only an owner can dedicate a road, not a lessee or licensee.\nThe property owner is required to allow the entire public the use of the dedicated area. For example, the creation of a way connecting two lots owned by the same person which passed over a third lot owned by that person would not constitute an intention to dedicate the way to the public. Likewise, a covenant in a deed stating that title would revert if a building were ever constructed on certain land does not amount to a dedication.\nIn most cases, dedication of a street gives the public the immediate right of passage over the street. The reason for this conclusion requires an analysis of the distinction between public acceptance to use a dedicated street versus acceptance to maintain a street, addressed later in these materials. Dedication alone does not burden the municipality with the duty of maintenance unless the municipality accepts the dedication."

The roots of the tree caused the sidewalk to buckle severely and become dangerous. An ordinance of City requires adjacent landowners to keep sidewalks in safe condition. House engaged Contractor to repair the sidewalk, leaving it to Contractor to decide how the repair should be made.

Two days after House had paid Contractor the agreed price of the repair, the tree fell over onto the street and damaged a parked car belonging to Driver.

Here both possession of the corpus and enjoyment of the income are postponed; unless the beneficiary lives to be twenty-one he will get neither. Whether his interest may be said to be ‘vested‘ or not is unimportant, for as indicated both in the committee reports and in the Regulations an interest ‘whether vested or contingent‘ is a ‘future interest‘, if it is limited to commence in possession or enjoyment at some future date. Nor is it important, if true, that the interest of the minor beneficiary may in some way be available to his creditors,2 for the availability of an interest for the satisfaction of claims of creditors is not inconsistent with its being a ‘future interest‘. See Restatement, supra, Secs. 166-169. As applied to the interests of a beneficiary under a trust, a ‘future interest‘ is used by way of contrast to a ‘present interest‘, which is characterized by the Restatement, supra, Sec. 153, as ‘the right to the immediate beneficial enjoyment of the proceeds of the trust‘. The minor beneficiaries in the present case clearly have not the right to the immediate beneficial enjoyment of the trust income."

    "question": "In 1975, Utility constructed a new plant for the generation of electricity. The plant burns lignite, a low -grade fuel which is available in large quantities. Although the plant was constructed in accordance with the best practicable technology, the plant emits a substantial quantity of invisible fumes. The only way Utility can reduce the fumes is by the use of scrubbing equipment that would cost $50,000,000 to install and would increase the retail price of generated electricity by 50 per cent while reducing the volume of fumes by only 20 per cent. Because of the expense of such equipment and its relative ineffectiveness, no other generating plants burning lignite use such equipment. The plant was located in a sparsely settled rural area, remote from the large city served by Utility. Farmer owned a farm adjacent to the plant. He had farmed the land for forty years and lived on the premises. The prevailing winds carried fumes from tIe new plant over Farmer's land. His 1975 crop was less than half the average size of his crop over the five years immediately preceding the construction of the plant. It can be established that the fumes caused the crop reduction. Farmer's hay fever, from which he had long suffered, became worse in 1976. Physicians advised him that the lignite fumes were affecting it and that serious lung disease would soon result unless he moved away from the plant.

Under proper management, the farm was capable of producing an adequate family income. Because of the usual deterioration accompanying old age, Seth was unable to do farm work or even to provide for his own personal needs. Seth entered into an oral contract with his nephew, Jim, by which Seth agreed to convey the farm to Jim and Jim agreed to move into the house with Seth, operate the farm, and take care of Seth for the rest of his life.

That is, did the defect exist when the product left the manufacturer's hands, or did it result from later alterations by someone else? (2) What is the effect of the alteration? Given that the product was altered or modified by a person other than the manufacturer, did this alteration constitute a substantial change” that should bar the plaintiff's recovery?\nThis article focuses on cases in which the product was altered by someone other than the manufacturer (such as the plaintiff or the plaintiff's employer), thus concentrating on the second set of issues, those relating to whether the change in the product was “substantial,” relieving the manufacturer of liability."

In white-collar criminal law, principles of federalism have influenced how the Supreme Court has interpreted the broadly-worded mail and wire fraud statutes, particularly in prosecutions of state and local officials, as we have previously discussed. See, e.g., Elkan Abramowitz & Jonathan Sack, Limits on the Scope of Honest Services Fraud, N.Y.L.J., Nov. 7, 2017. The Supreme Court has expressed reservations about federal prosecutors becoming excessively involved in the regulation of state and local political behavior.\nIn its present term, the Supreme Court will hear an appeal arising from the controversy known as “Bridgegate”: the politically-motivated closure in 2013 of two lanes on the George Washington Bridge that served Fort Lee, N.J. The government alleged that defendants Bridget Kelly and William Baroni Jr. ordered the lanes closed for political reasons which they concealed by falsely saying the closure was part of a “traffic study.” The Supreme Court granted certiorari to decide the defendants’ claim that the federal wire fraud statute should not be held to extend to the sharp-elbowed local politics underlying the prosecution.

    "ctx": "The U.S. Constitution establishes a system of dual sovereignty between the states and the federal government, with each state having its own government, endowed with all the functions essential to separate and independent existence. Although the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution designates “the Laws of the United States” as “the supreme Law of the Land,” other provisions of the Constitution—as well as legal principles undergirding those provisions—nonetheless prohibit the national government from enacting certain types of laws that impinge upon state sovereignty. The various principles that delineate the proper boundaries between the powers of the federal and state governments are collectively known as “federalism.” Federalism-based restrictions that the Constitution imposes on the national government’s ability to enact legislation may inform Congress’s work in any number of areas of law in which the states and the federal government dually operate. There are two central ways in which the Constitution imposes federalism-based limitations on Congress’s powers. First, Congress’s powers are restricted by and to the terms of express grants of power in the Constitution, which thereby establish internal constraints on the federal government’s authority. The Constitution explicitly grants Congress a limited set of carefully defined enumerated powers, while reserving most other legislative powers to the states. As a result, Congress may not enact any legislation that exceeds the scope of its limited enumerated powers. That said, Congress’s enumerated powers nevertheless do authorize the federal government to enact legislation that may significantly influence the scope of power exercised by the states. For instance, subject to certain restrictions, Congress may utilize its taxing and spending powers to encourage states to undertake certain types of actions that Congress might otherwise lack the constitutional authority to undertake on its own. Similarly, the Supreme Court has interpreted the Constitution’s Commerce Clause to afford Congress substantial (but not unlimited) authority to regulate certain purely intrastate economic activitiesthat substantially affect interstate commerce in the aggregate. Congress may also enact certain types of legislation in order to implement international treaties. Additionally, pursuant to a collection of constitutional amendments ratified shortly after the Civil War, Congress may directly regulate the states in limited respects in order to prevent states from depriving persons of certain procedural and substantive rights. Finally, the Necessary and Proper Clause augments Congress’s enumerated powers by empowering the federal government to enact laws that are “necessary and proper” to execute its express powers."

Whoever in the course of driving a motor vehicle as defined in the Vehicle Code is criminally negligent in driving such vehicle or omits to do anything that is his duty to do and shows a wanton and reckless disregard for the safety of other persons and as a result of such act or omission causes the death of a human being is guilty of vehicular manslaughter. Vehicular manslaughter is punishable by a sentence of not more than 10 years in the state prison or not more than one year in the county jail. In a particular jurisdiction there are no statutory standards for the amount of alcohol required to be in the blood to create a presumption that a person is under the influence of alcohol. Defendant, an alcoholic, while driving his motor vehicle, collided with another vehicle. A passenger was killed. Defendant is charged with vehicular manslaughter. Experts will testify that a person with blood alcohol of 0.00 to 0.05 per cent is not under the influence. From 0.05 to 0.10 per cent he may be under the influence. Most of those with 0.10 to 0.15 per cent are under the influence. All of those with over 0.15 per cent are under the influence. Defendant consented to and was given a blood alcohol test 60 minutes after the accident. The test showed 0.11 per cent alcohol.

    "ctx": "The difficulty lies in the meaning to be assigned to foreseeable risk.  It has been noted that in determining whether certain events are within the risk created, the courts have been compelled of necessity to resort to hindsight rather than foresight. Restatement (Second) of Torts, § 281 comment g (1965). A post hoc step by step analysis, however, can render “foreseeable” almost anything that has in fact occurred. Cf. Petition of Kinsman Transit Company, 338 F.2d 708, 723 (1964). The courts have thus defined the foreseeable risk broadly:\nNot only is the concept of foreseeability itself elastic and capable of expansion, but also it is generally recognized that the particular manner in which the injury is brought about need not be foreseeable by any test. It has been well said, “The fact is, that the consequences of negligence are almost invariably surprises.” This concept is an antidote to the requirement that plaintiff be injured by one of the dangers or risks that made defendant's conduct negligent. There is often no hard and fast line between the risk or hazard (which must be foreseeable) and the manner in which an accident happens (which need not be). The tendency of these two notions to pull in opposite directions, therefore, both invites the courts to define the risk or hazard broadly, and also gives courts a choice to treat the freak case on an individualized basis.\n2 F. Harper and F. James, The Law of Torts, § 18.2 at 1026–27 (1956) (footnotes omitted) (quoting Chavers v. A.R. Blossman, 45 So.2d 398, 402 (La.App.1950)).\nOur supreme court has similarly defined the term “foreseeable risk” broadly:\nThe Palsgraf principle requires that liability be imposed only where both the plaintiff and the risk are foreseeable to a reasonable person. The holding here is that a broad view must be taken of the class of risks and victims that are foreseeable.\nMcFarlin v. Hall, 127 Ariz. 220, 222, 619 P.2d 729, 731 (1980)."

California Province of the Society of Jesus, 196 F.3d 940, 948 (9th Cir.1999). *42 Substantive entanglement involves the same concerns as the Free Exercise Clause analysis and may occur, for example, when a “church's freedom to choose its ministers is at stake.” Id. at 948–49. Thus, where a minister seeks redress for termination, failure to hire, changes in work schedule, or other similar decisions involving, at their heart, a church's core right to decide who (and in what manner he or she) may propagate its religious beliefs, the Establishment Clause clearly prevents review by a civil court. Id. at 946 (“A church's selection of its own clergy is one such core matter of ecclesiastical self-governance with which the state may not constitutionally interfere.” ) (citing **850 Milivojevich, supra, 426 U.S. at 717, 96 S.Ct. at 2384, 49 L.Ed.2d at 167; Kedroff, supra, 344 U.S. at 116, 73 S.Ct. at 154–55, 97 L.Ed. at 136; Gonzalez v.

Wolf, 443 U.S. 595, 603, 99 S.Ct. 3020, 3035, 61 L.Ed.2d 775 (1979)); Schmoll v. Chapman Univ., 70 Cal.App.4th 1434, 83 Cal.Rptr.2d 426, 427–28 (1999) (holding that First Amendment bars judicial scrutiny of religious university's decision to reduce chaplain's hours and benefits); cf. Welter v. Seton Hall Univ., 128 N.J. 279, 291, 295–96, 608 A.2d 206 (1992) (recognizing that court cannot constitutionally adjudicate claims concerning decision to hire or fire employees “charged with propagating the religion” but holding that nuns hired to teach computer science classes and who performed no ministerial functions were not barred by First Amendment from maintaining breach of express contract claim for their discharge).\nProcedural entanglement, on the other hand, might result “from a protracted legal process pitting church and state as adversaries.” Rayburn, supra, 772 F.2d at 1171; see also *43 NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, 440 U.S. 490, 502, 99 S.Ct. 1313, 1320, 59 L.Ed.2d 533, 542 (1979) (“It is not only the conclusions that may be reached by the Board which may impinge on rights guaranteed by the Religion Clauses, but also the very process of inquiry leading to findings and conclusions.” ) (footnote omitted). Additional procedural entanglement concerns may include a “far-reaching” impact of remedies on a church, such as the potential for “protracted government surveillance of church activities.” Bollard, supra, 196 F.3d at 949."

    "ctx": "Had defendant's bid expressly stated or clearly implied that it was revocable at any time before acceptance we would treat it accordingly. It was silent on revocation, however, and we must therefore determine whether there are conditions to the right of revocation imposed by law or reasonably inferable in fact.  In the analogous problem of an offer for a unilateral contract, the theory is now obsolete that the offer is revocable at any time before complete performance. Thus section 45 of the Restatement of Contracts provides: ‘If an offer for a unilateral contract is made, and part of the consideration requested in the offer is given or tendered by the offeree in response thereto, the offeror is bound by a contract, the duty of immediate performance of which is conditional on the full consideration being given or tendered within the time stated in the offer, or, if no time is stated therein, within a reasonable time.’ In explanation, comment b states that the ‘main offer includes as a subsidiary promise, necessarily implied, that if part of the requested performance is given, the offeror will not revoke his offer, and that if tender is made it will be accepted. Part performance or tender may thus furnish consideration for the subsidiary promise. Moreover, merely acting in justifiable reliance on an offer may in some cases serve as sufficient reason for making a promise binding (see s 90).’\nWhether implied in fact or law, the subsidiary promise serves to preclude the injustice that would result if the offer could be revoked after the offeree had acted in detrimental reliance thereon.  Reasonable reliance resulting in a foreseeable prejudicial change in position affords a compelling basis also for implying a subsidiary promise not to revoke an offer for a bilateral contract.\nThe absence of consideration is not fatal to the enforcement of such a promise. It is true that in the case of unilateral contracts the Restatement finds consideration for the implied subsidiary promise in the part performance of the bargained-for exchange, but its reference to section 90 makes clear that consideration for such a promise is not always necessary. The very purpose of section 90 is to make a promise binding even though there was no consideration ‘in the sense of something that is bargained for and given in exchange.’ (See 1 Corbin, Contracts 634 et seq.) Reasonable reliance serves to hold the offeror in lieu of the consideration ordinarily required to make the offer binding. In a case involving similar facts the Supreme Court of South Dakota stated that ‘we believe that reason and justice demand that the doctrine (of section 90) be applied to the present facts. We cannot believe that by accepting this doctrine as controlling in the state of facts before us we will abolish the requirement of a consideration in contract *415 cases, in any different sense than an ordinary estoppel abolishes some legal requirement in its application. We are of the opinion, therefore, that the defendants in executing the agreement (which was not supported by consideration) made a promise which they should have reasonably expected would induce the plaintiff to submit a bid based thereon to the Government, that such promise did induce this action, and that injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.’ Northwestern Engineering Co. v. Ellerman, 69 S.D. 397, 408, 10 N.W.2d 879, 884; see also, Robert Gordon, Inc., v. Ingersoll-Rand Co., 7 Cir., 117 F.2d 654, 661; cf. James Baird Co. v. Gimbel Bros., 2 Cir., 64 F.2d 344.\nWhen plaintiff used defendant's offer in computing his own bid, he bound himself to perform in reliance on defendant's terms. Though defendant did not bargain for this use of its bid neither did defendant make it idly, indifferent to whether it would be used or not. On the contrary it is reasonable to suppose that defendant submitted its bid to obtain the subcontract. It was bound to realize the substantial possibility that its bid would be the lowest, and that it would be included by plaintiff in his bid. It was to its own interest that the contractor be awarded the general contract; the lower the subcontract bid, the lower the general contractor's bid was likely to be and the greater its cnance of acceptance and hence the greater defendant's chance of getting the paving subcontract. Defendant had reason not only to expect plaintiff to rely on its bid but to want him to. Clearly defendant had a stake in plaintiff's reliance on its bid. Given this interest and the fact that plaintiff is bound by his own bid, it is only fair that plaintiff should have at least an opportunity to accept defendant's bid after the general contract has been awarded to him."

The use of race in these situations is “utterly irrational” because it is completely unrelated to any valid public purpose; moreover, it is particularly pernicious because it constitutes a badge of oppression that is unfaithful to the central promise of the Fourteenth Amendment."

She frequented taverns and drank heavily. One evening in a bar she became acquainted with Duke. He believed her when she told him her claimed age. They had several drinks and became inebriated. Later, they drove in Duke's car to a secluded spot. After they had necked for a while, Duke propositioned Linda and she consented. Before Duke achieved penetration, Linda changed her mind, saying, \"Stop! Don't touch me! I don't want to do it.\" When Duke did not desist, Linda started to cry and said, \"I am only fifteen.\" Duke immediately jumped from the car and ran away.

The will had no residuary clause. Owen was survived by Bill and by Owen's daughter, Della, who was Owen's sole heir. For the purpose of this set of questions, it may be assumed that the common law rule against perpetuities applies in the state where the land is located and that the state also has a statute providing that, \"All future estates and interests are alienable, descendible, and devisable in the same manner as possessory estates and interests.\" In 1946 the interest of the American Red Cross in Blackacre could be best described as a",

An executory interest is a future interest, held by a third person, that either cuts off another's interest or begins after the natural termination of a preceding estate.

Brown believed God told him several times that the local Roman Catholic bishop was corrupting the diocese into heresy, and that the bishop should be \"done away with.\" Brown, a devout Catholic, conceived of himself as a religious martyr. He knew that shooting bishops for heresy is against the criminal law. He nevertheless carefully planned how he might kill the bishop. One evening Brown shot the bishop, who was taken to the hospital where he died two weeks later. Brown told the police he assumed the institutions of society would support the ecclasiastical hierarchy, and he expected to be persecuted for his God-inspired actions. Psychiatrist Stevens examined Brown and found that Brown suffered from schizophrenic psychosis, that in the absence of this psychosis he would not have shot the bishop, and that because of the psychosis Brown found it extremely difficult to determine whether he should obey the specific command that he do away with the bishop or the general commandment \"Thou shalt not kill.\" Brown was charged with murder.

City of Eugene, 336 Or. 181, 81 P.3d 702 (2003), the court concluded that ORS 28.020—which allows a person to seek a declaratory judgment if the person’s rights “are affected by a constitution, statute, municipal charter, ordinance, contract or franchise”—codifies a ripeness requirement for justiciability of a declaratory relief action. 336 Or. at 191, 81 P.3d 702; see also Beck, 202 Or. App. at 366, 122 P.3d 131 (describing U.S. West Communications as “appl[ying] the test for ripeness set out in [two prior cases] in which the court explicitly identified ripeness as a jurisdictional issue”). “[T]he legislature’s use of the present tense phrase ‘are affected’ implies [that] the controversy must involve a dispute based on present facts rather than on contingent or hypothetical events.” U.S. West Communications, 336 Or. at 191, 81 P.3d 702. Similarly, ORS 34.040 requires that “a substantial interest of a plaintiff has been injured” (emphasis added), thereby codifying a ripeness requirement for justiciability of a writ of review proceeding."

This is an issue of first impression. Nothing in the plain language of Code § 19.2-295.1 requires that a “record of conviction” be established only by the admission of a final order of conviction. The language of Code § 19.2-295.1 describes a “record,” not an “order.” The plain meaning of the word “record” is\n[a] written account of some act, court proceeding, transaction, or instrument, drawn up, under authority of law, by a proper officer, and designed to remain as a memorial or permanent evidence of the matters to which it relates. Black's Law Dictionary 1144 (5th ed.1979).  Thus, we find that “record of conviction” means a “record” evidencing the fact of conviction. While a final order of conviction may be the most expedient means of establishing a “record of conviction,” we do not find Code § 19.2-295.1 limited to such evidence."

    "ctx": "Most dangerous property conditions are the result of a failure to maintain the property in good condition. Inadequate maintenance can give rise to a slip and fall, negligent security, or a swimming pool accident. Some typical types of inadequate maintenance include unrepaired fixtures, fallen merchandise, spills, broken windows, cracked sidewalks or tiles, broken locks, lack of security cameras, loose handrails, cluttered walkways, and overgrown vegetation. Duty to Inspect\nOwners or occupiers typically have a duty to inspect their property at reasonable intervals to discover dangerous conditions, regardless of whether they receive complaints. All property owners are expected to maintain their properties and make reasonable repairs to avoid injuries to visitors to the property. However, in practice, property owners are often behind in inspecting, identifying, and fixing any dangerous conditions. It is only after someone is actually injured that the property owner takes steps to repair a dangerous condition or obtain adequate security. For example, customers may complain that there are broken lights near the entrance of a dance club, but it may be only after somebody is mugged or raped that the property owner fixes the broken lights. Condominiums or homeowners' associations can also be held liable for failing to maintain a common area or to keep the common area clear of preventable hazards. The paperwork that creates the condominium board or homeowners' association may spell out the obligations of that entity on the property. Among other things, it may define common areas for which the entity is responsible. Liability is usually found if the condominium or homeowners' association created the hazard, or if it knew or should have known of the hazard. For example, the owners of individual units may complain to the condominium or homeowners' association that steps on the ladder of the common swimming pool are broken. If the condominium board fails to make repairs or makes repairs negligently, and somebody is injured, the board may have to pay damages."

    "question": "The city of Metropolis has an ordinance that makes it an offense, punishable by fine, for the owner of a dog to permit the dog to run unleashed on a public way. Smythe, a police officer, observed a small dog running loose in the street. As he picked the dog up, Nelson, who was seated in her car lawfully parked at the curb, called out, \"Oh, thank you, Officer, for returning Fido.\" Smythe asked Nelson whether the dog was hers, and when she acknowledged ownership, he asked her to see her driver's license. Nelson gave her name and address, but she refused to produce a driver's license. Smythe then told her to produce her driver's license if she did not want to go to jail. Nelson responded by saying, \"Isn't this ridiculous?\" Smythe took her by the arm and said, \"Let's go. You are under arrest.\" Nelson cried out that Smythe was hurting her but he refused to release her arm, and she struck him with her free hand. Smythe then dragged Nelson from her car, forced her into his squad car, and took her to the police station. The incident took place on the street in front of the apartment where Nelson and her aged father, Joplin, lived.

    "ctx": "A life tenant's relation to the remainderman is a quasi-fiduciary one in the sense that he must exercise reasonable care to preserve the property intact for transmission to the remainderman and in that he can legally do nothing to prejudice or defeat the estate of the remainderman. \"[N]o such fiduciary relations exist between a life tenant and his remainderman as to make applicable to their transactions the rules of equity which govern trustees and cestuis que trustent, and preclude the life tenant from acquiring by gift or purchase from the remainderman his estate in remainder.\" Muzzy v. Muzzy, 364 Mo. 373, 380, 261 S.W.2d 927, 931 (1953). The life tenant has the obligation to list and pay the taxes on the property. Therefore he cannot defeat the estate of the remainderman by allowing the land to be sold for taxes and taking title in himself by purchase at the tax sale. The life tenant's purchase at a tax sale \"is regarded as a payment of the tax, and the owner of the future interest is regarded as still holding under his original title.\" Simes and Smith, The Law of Future Interests, § 1700 (2d ed. 1956). In addition to the taxes, absent a different stipulation in the instrument creating the life estate, a life tenant owes a duty to the remaindermen to pay the interest accruing during the period of his estate on a mortgage encumbrance given prior to the creation of the life estate and remainder or reversion, at least to the extent of the income or rental value of the property. Simes and Smith, supra, § 1697. See 31 C.J.S. Estates § 48 (1964); 51 Am.Jur.2d, supra, § 277. \"Being bound to pay the taxes and interest, he [a life tenant] cannot acquire a tax title or good title based on his failing to pay taxes or interest. He is a trustee to this extent.\" Miller v. Marriner, supra at 457, 121 S.E. at 774. If an encumbrance is foreclosed because of the default on the part of the life tenant in the payment of interest or otherwise, and he becomes the purchaser at the foreclosure sale, \"he thereby restores the life estate and the estate in the remainder. In respect to a prior mortgage lien on the whole estate, unless obligated by the instrument creating his estate, the life tenant's only duty to the remainderman is to pay the interest. He is under no obligation to pay any part of the principal. When a life tenant, in order to preserve his estate, \"pays off an encumbrance upon the fee or estate property, whether the encumbrance is a mortgage, lien, charge or other type of encumbrance, he is entitled to reimbursement from the owners of future interests, such as reversioners or remaindermen, to the extent of their interest in the property which was subject to the encumbrance.\" 51 Am. Jur.2d, supra, § 275. See 31 C.J.S. Estates § 48 (1964); 1 Tiffany, supra, § 63. He \"has a lien on the future interest for the amount which its owner is under a duty to pay. When a mortgage falls due during the period of the life estate the question arises: Who has the burden of paying the principal? In Simes and Smith, The Law of Future Interests, § 1697 (2d ed. 1956), the question is answered as follows: \"Courts have generally indicated that life tenant and reversioner or remainderman must each pay his due proportion of this amount. To require them to share the burden would seem to be just. By paying off the mortgage, the value of both life estate and future interest have been increased in proportion to their respective values. Hence it would seem that the due proportion would be based upon the respective values of life estate and the remainder or reversion. The cases, however, are not clear as to what a due proportion of the principal is.\" The foregoing statement accords with the Restatement of Property § 132 (1936). Explanatory Comment e. under this section says that the proportionate contributions of the life estate and future interests to the payment of an encumbrance \"are computable by employing the mortality tables and rate of interest regularly employed in valuing an estate for life in the state wherein the affected land is located.\" Id. at p. 433. See Faulkenburg v. Windorf, 194 Minn. 154, 157, 259 N.W. 802, 804 (1935). In Comment a. to § 132, supra, it is noted that absent some special provision in the instrument creating the estate for life, the life tenant has no duty to contribute from his other assets to the payment of the encumbrance. \"He can, however, be compelled to choose between giving up his estate for life and making a contribution, from his other assets, to the new investment of capital.\" Id. at p. 431. When a mortgage, deed of trust or other encumbrance on the whole estate, the burden of which does not fall solely on the life tenant, is foreclosed, the life tenant may purchase the property at the sale in order to protect his interest. Yet he cannot purchase the fee on a foreclosure sale so as to exclude the remainderman if the remainderman is willing to contribute his share of the cost of acquisition within a reasonable time. \"It is uniformly held that the purchase of land by a life tenant at a foreclosure sale under a mortgage or deed of trust will be deemed to have been made for the benefit of the remainderman or reversioner *745 if he contributes his portion of the purchase money within a reasonable time."

If a devisee subject to an equitable charge fails to pay the equitable encumbrancer the sum to which he is entitled, the latter's remedy is a suit in equity to obtain a decree for the sale of the land to pay the charge; if a trustee fails to perform his duties under the trust, the remedy of the beneficiary is a suit in equity to compel specific performance or redress of the breach of trust.”"

    "ctx": "A brief discussion of the nature of impeachment evidence would be helpful here. Unlike substantive evidence which is offered for the purpose of persuading the trier of fact as to the truth of a proposition on which the determination of the tribunal is to be asked, impeachment is that which is designed to discredit a witness, i. e., to reduce the effectiveness of his testimony by bringing forth evidence which explains why the jury should not put faith in him or his testimony. Examples of impeachment evidence would include prior inconsistent statements, bias, attacks on character of a witness, prior felony convictions, and attacks on the capacity of the witness to observe, recall or relate. See Udall, Arizona Law of Evidence, §§ 61–69, pp. 79–112.\nEvidence may be both substantive and impeaching. In our earlier hypothetical of the surveillance movie, the movie may be substantive proof of the plaintiff's injuries or lack thereof and it may be used to discredit her testimony. Another example would be evidence that a party was intoxicated. It is substantive evidence of negligence or contributory negligence and it also serves to discredit this party."

    "ctx": "In real estate, the chain of title is the history of the property’s ownership. When a property is sold, the title is transferred, and these transfers form the chain. Researching the chain of title is among the tasks performed by a title company when a buyer signs a contract to purchase a property. The chain of title for any property is found in the relevant county recorder’s office, and there’s no reason you can’t conduct your own search to determine the chain of title. All the information is in the public record. Keep in mind that state laws governing the recording of real estate transfers differ, so the chain of title process in one state may differ somewhat from the chain of title process in another. \nChain of Title Documents Formal documents maintain the chain of title. The chain ends with the most recent document affecting the property. Types of documents included are:\nTransfer Documents\nFinancial Documents\nInvoluntary Liens\nCovenants and Restrictions\nEasements\nTransfer documents (deeds) document the transfer of ownership. The deed conveys the property from the seller, or grantor, to the buyer, or grantee. The deed also includes a detailed description of the property.Financial documents (mortgages and deeds of trust) are voluntary liens, as the creditor enters into an agreement with a lender to borrow money to purchase the property. Until the debt is paid off, generally in 15 or 30 years, the lender has title to the property. Once the mortgage is paid, the former creditor owns the property “free and clear.” The date of the mortgage or lien determines which lien is a priority for payment if there is more than one lien in competition. A deed of trust, also known as a trust deed, assigns the property to a trustee. The trustee holds the title as security for a loan between the lender and the borrower. In such a case, the lender is known as the beneficiary and the borrower as the trustor.\nInvoluntary lien documents include liens, lis pendens and tax liens. Involuntary liens, as the name implies, are liens that arise without the owner’s consent, usually due to nonpayment of debts. Examples of involuntary liens include property tax liens when local property taxes are not paid; income tax liens, for failure to pay the IRS; judgment liens from a creditor, ordered by the court, and mechanic’s liens. The latter is filed by contractors if the owner does not pay for work done on the property. Involuntary liens “cloud” the title and require payment before the property changes hands. In some cases, the property is sold at auction to satisfy the lien. A lis pendens is notice that a lawsuit has been filed regarding the property’s title or ownership.\nCovenants and restrictions are documents creating restrictions on the use of the subject property. Such restrictions may include limits on the types of improvements made to the property, uses of the property and property occupancy. Older homes may have covenants not permitting the sale of the property to people of certain racial or religious backgrounds, but these covenants are no longer enforceable.\nEasements, also known as rights of way, are documents affecting usage rights. There are various types of easements, including:\nUtility easements — allowing utility companies access to the property for the purpose of maintaining electrical lines, water/sewer lines and the like. These are the most common types of easements and affect most properties.\nPrivate easements — a private easement allows another party, usually a neighbor, access through the property. It may mean direct access, such as a shared driveway, or non-direct access. An example of the latter is solar access, which means the owner cannot build or plant anything on the property that would affect a neighbor’s solar collection.\nEasement by necessity — in some situations, the only way a neighboring landowner can access their property is by going through an adjacent property. This is known as easement by necessity, and the property owner cannot interfere with the neighbor’s ability to access his or her land.\nOther documents involved in the chain of title may include:\nDeath certificates, when the property passes to a joint tenant through the right of survivorship. This joint tenant is generally the decedent’s spouse.\nAffidavits, documents that affirm a fact related to the property\nCorrection deeds, used to correct an error in a previously recorded document\nChain of Title Breaks\nSometimes, there is a break in the chain of title. This occurs if the title transfer was inaccurate – or fraudulent. Human error is often to blame, especially if paperwork is filed in haste. That’s often the case during real estate booms, when lawyers and lenders were simply overwhelmed by the sheer amount of business. Common errors include misspellings of names of the grantor or grantee, incorrect legal descriptions of the property, lack of signatures on the deed, mistakes in when the chain of title documents were recorded, and even filing the deed in the wrong county. When there is a break in the chain of title, correction is necessary. The simplest ways to correct such breaks is to have the property owner go to court and seek quiet title action. Depending on the nature of the break, a judge can rule that the break is not relevant and no longer exists. However, if the break is known to have resulted due to a particular party, the owner can seek out the party and have them fill out a quitclaim deed, which gives up any rights to the property they may have had.\nWhen it comes to chain of title and foreclosures, any break in the chain of title is a possible defense by an attorney for a foreclosed property owner.

    "ctx": "The US Constitution contains ambiguities regarding the roles of Congress and the President in making foreign policy. In practice, strong Presidents and legislators have often asserted their prerogatives in this area at the expense of the other. A case in point is the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review legislation, whereby Congress is insisting on approving the final agreement despite opposition by the Obama Administration. The debate over foreign policy powers arises from the language of the US Constitution that gives the President the power to make treaties and nominate Ambassadors and Executive Department leaders, with the advice and consent of the Senate. In addition to these responsibilities, the President acts as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and has the duty to receive Ambassadors and other public ministers from abroad. Since World War II, these powers have generally been interpreted as giving the President primacy in the conduct of US foreign policy. The Senate’s important role in the ratification of treaties and in approving Ambassadorial nominations and high ranking Executive Branch officials also is explicitly contained in the US Constitution. Other Constitutional sources of congressional power in foreign policy making include (1) the responsibility for appropriating all government monies, including foreign assistance; (2) the power to declare war under Article 1, Section 8 of the US Constitution and (3) the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations. Congress has used these powers to claim the right to limit or guide the President’s foreign policy, and on occasion has tried to initiate its own policies. The actions of Congress regarding foreign policy have drawn criticism from all presidents as meddling in presidential affairs. An example of congressional-presidential conflict over foreign policy powers is the debate that occurred over the use of US troops to liberate Kuwait following Iraq’s invasion in 1990. A group of House members sought a preliminary injunction in US Court to prevent George H.W.Bush from ordering US troops into offensive combat without specific congressional authorization. The court, however, was reluctant to become embroiled in war-making disputes between Legislative and Executive branches and refused the request. Ultimately, President Bush requested and Congress approved a resolution authorizing the use of military force to liberate Kuwait. A more recent example of Presidential-Congressional conflict occurred in 2002 when President George W. Bush received congressional approval for the use of force against Iraq in 2002. He used this approval to invade Iraq in early 2003. What appears to be lost is the congressional requirement to declare war. This requirement is being replaced by resolutions authorizing military activities. In effect, Congress is ceding its constitutional authority to declare war to the President. The Congress has made clear its desire that any military action in Syria or Iran require a congressional resolution authorizing the use of force against ISIL. The Administration broadly interprets the 2002 resolution as allowing the use of force to fight terrorism, while Congress insists the authority is limited to Iraq and wants a new resolution against ISIL. This is an on-going debate within Congress and there have been legislative moves that would replace the War Powers Act, but so far Congress has not acted on the legislation. By far, however, Congress’s greatest authority over US foreign policy is its “power of the purse”. Since Congress is given the sole power to appropriate monies, Constitutional experts believe Congress possesses the power to determine how money can be used. This determination can be expressed as a policy applicable to the use of funds or as a restriction or limitation on the use of funds. Congress’s power to determine whether or not to fund a particular country or program significantly affects US foreign policy."

Arthur paid all taxes, insurance, and other carrying charges on Goodacre. He paid no rent or other compensation to Celia, nor did Celia request any such payment. Thirty years later, a series of disputes arose between Arthur and Celia for the first time concerning their respective rights to Goodacre.

Actual ouster of a tenant in common by a cotenant in possession occurs when the possession is attended with such circumstances as to evince a claim of exclusive right and title and a denial of the right **857 of the other tenants to participate in the profits.

Felder [v. Fleming], 278 S.C. [327] at 330, 295 S.E.2d [640] at 642 [(1982)].

Therefore, personal services are more greatly valued than general labor. A contract for personal services usually imposes a duty to render the service, as well as a duty to forbear from rendering the service to a competitor. Some example of individuals who can perform personal services are actors, singers, athletes. \nAccording to the Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 367, “a promise to render personal service will not be specifically enforced” and “a promise to render personal service exclusively for one employer will not be enforced by an injunction against serving another if its probable result will be to compel a performance involving personal relations the enforced continuance of which is undesirable or will be to leave the employee without other reasonable means of making a living.” The rationale for this refusal to require specific performance of a personal services contract is that it would not be desirable to further personal associations between parties if there have already been disputes leading to a loss of confidence and loyalty. In addition, the quality of the personal services performance may be lowered if an individual’s sole motivation for performing is because he or she compelled to fulfill a contract obligation under law, but quality of performance is difficult to judge and quantify."

Specifically, double jeopardy protects against:\na prosecution for the same offense after an acquittal\na prosecution for the same offense after a conviction, and\nmore than one punishment for the same offense.\nA defendant facing any of these scenarios can hold up the Double Jeopardy Clause as a shield.\nThere are clear instances when this shield is available, such as when a jury has acquitted a defendant and the state brings the same charges a second time. (If the prosecution discovered new evidence of the defendant's guilt after the initial trial, too bad.) Double jeopardy also bars punishment in certain prototypical scenarios—for example, when a judge tries to resentence someone who has already served the punishment for the crime in question.\nBut there's often not an obvious answer as to whether the Double Jeopardy Clause applies. Certain principles guide courts in making the determination."

    "ctx": "There are definite limits on the effectiveness of joint ownership as a probate-avoidance strategy.Probate is not avoided when the last owner dies. The probate-avoidance part of joint tenancy works only at the death of the first co-owner. (Or, if there are three joint tenants, only at the death of the first two, and so on.) When the last co-owner dies, the property must go through probate before it goes to whomever inherits it, unless the last owner used a different probate-avoidance method, such as transferring the property to a living trust. By contrast, some other probate-avoidance devices, such as living trusts or payable-on-death accounts, let you name a beneficiary who will inherit free of probate when the second co-owner dies.\nProbate is not avoided if both owners die simultaneously. In that very unlikely event, each owner's share of the property would pass under the terms of his or her will. If a joint tenant died without a valid will, the property would go to each owner's closest relatives under state law. Either way, probate would probably be necessary.\nOne owner's incapacity may hobble the others. If one joint owner became incapacitated and could not make decisions, the other owners' freedom to act would be restricted. This problem can be avoided if each joint owner signs a document called a \"Durable Power of Attorney,\" giving someone authority to manage their affairs if they cannot, or if the property is transferred to a living trust."

The amount awarded is intended to make good or replace the loss caused by the breach.\nThere are two kinds of compensatory damages that the nonbreaching party may be entitled to recover:\nA. General Damages. General damages cover the loss directly and necessarily incurred by the breach of contract. General damages are the most common type of damages awarded for breaches of contract.\nExample: Company A delivered the wrong kind of furniture to Company B. After discovering the mistake later in the day, Company B insisted that Company A pick up the wrong furniture and deliver the right furniture. Company A refused to pick up the furniture and said that it could not supply the right furniture because it was not in stock. Company B successfully sued for breach of contract. The general damages for this breach could include:\n• refund of any amount Company B had prepaid for the furniture; plus \n• reimbursement of any expense Company B incurred in sending the furniture back to Company A; plus\n• payment for any increase in the cost Company B incurred in buying the right furniture, or its nearest equivalent, from another seller.\nB. Special Damages. Special damages (also called “consequential damages”) cover any loss incurred by the breach of contract because of special circumstances or conditions that are not ordinarily predictable. These are actual losses caused by the breach, but not in a direct and immediate way. To obtain damages for this type of loss, the nonbreaching party must prove that the breaching party knew of the special circumstances or requirements at the time the contract was made.\nExample: In the scenario above, if Company A knew that Company B needed the new furniture on a particular day because its old furniture was going to be carted away the night before, the damages for breach of contract could include all of the damages awarded in the scenario above, plus:\n• payment for Company B’s expense in renting furniture until the right furniture arrived."

    "ctx": "“Not guilty by reason of insanity” is a plea entered by a defendant in a criminal trial, where the defendant claims that they were so mentally disturbed or incapacitated at the time of the offense that they did not have the required intention to commit the crime, and are therefore not guilty. The Bouvier Law Dictionary explains that not guilty by reason of insanity is a plea “essentially admitting the defendant committed the act of the offense yet denying responsibility because the defendant lacked the capacity to act with criminal intent at the time.” It can also be a verdict entered by a jury in a criminal case, stating that the defendant cannot be held guilty because of the defendant’s insanity (however, such a verdict may require the defendant to be admitted into a mental institution).\n The defense of “not guilty by reason of insanity” goes to the concept of mens rea. Most offenses have two components: actus reus and mens rea. Actus reus is the requirement that the individual must have committed the criminal act and mens rea is the requirement that the individual have the required mental state, such as negligence, recklessness, etc. when committing the crime. Under this framework, a defendant can plead that they did not have the required mens rea for the crime because they were insane at the time they committed the crime, i.e. their insanity negated their culpability in the crime. For example, the crime of intentional murder requires that an individual have killed the victim intentionally. However, if the individual makes a showing that they were insane at the time they committed the murder and therefore could not have committed it “intentionally,” the individual may be deemed as not-guilty. Insanity is classified as an excuse defense. Principle behind the defense is that the behavior of a defendant who is not acting as a free moral agent is not worthy of social condemnation through the institution of punishment. To prove legal insanity, defendants usually put forth expert testimony on their psychological evaluation. Various jurisdictions use various test to judge such pleas (for example, cognitive test, irresistible impulse test, substantial capacity test, etc.). Compare with “guilty but mentally ill.”"

The contract provided for specified progress payments and a final payment of $40,000 upon Homey's acceptance of the house and issuance of a certificate of final approval by the architect.

For this question only, assume the following facts. Because she was overextended on other construction jobs, Structo did not complete the house until October 15.

As with the first prong, courts will generally defer to the parties if the parties stipulate that the amount of liquidated damages is a reasonable estimate of the damages that will likely result from delays to project completion.  If such a stipulation exists, this will be difficult to overcome, so contractors and subcontractors should refuse to sign such a stipulation if you believe the amount of liquidated damages is unreasonable.\nNext, because liquidated damages are meant to approximate actual damages, courts will consider whether the liquidated damages amount is based on a reasonable estimate of actual damages made by the owner or contractor, or whether the liquidated damages amount was simply a random arbitrary amount.  Lastly, the court will look to whether liquidated damages are shockingly disproportionate to actual damages.  Courts have held that liquidated damages twice the amount of actual damages were reasonably proportionate to actual damages.  Thus, the party opposing liquidated damages will need to show that liquidated damages far exceed actual damages to succeed in having them ruled an unenforceable penalty."

The stopper struck and injured Paul's eye. Paul had opened other bottles of champagne, and occasionally the stoppers had shot out with great force, but Paul had not been injured. Paul has brought an action against Winery, Inc., alleging that the bottle that caused his injury was defective and unreasonably dangerous because its label did not warn that the stopper might suddenly shoot out during opening.

The statute provides that the Commission may issue a license authorizing the construction of a proposed nuclear energy plant 30 days after the Commission makes a finding that the plant will comply with specified standards of safety, technological and commercial feasibility, and public convenience. In a severable provision, the Commission's enabling statute also provides that the Congress, by simple majorities in each house, may veto the issuance of a particular license by the Commission if such a veto occurs within 30 days following the required Commission finding. Early last year, the Commission found that Safenuke, Inc., met all statutory requirements and, therefore, voted to issue Safenuke, Inc., a license authorizing it to construct a nuclear energy plant. Because they believed that the issuance of a license to Safenuke, Inc., was not in accord with the applicable statutory criteria, a majority of each of the two houses of Congress voted, within the specified 30-day period, to veto the license. On the basis of that veto, the Commission refused to issue the license.

    "ctx": "Penal Law § 20.00 provides that a person may be held criminally liable as an accomplice when he performs certain acts and does so “with the mental culpability required for the commission” of the substantive crime. Despite this language, defendant argues, based on case law predating the present Penal Law, that even though the substantive crime with which he was charged--criminal sale of a controlled substance--requires only knowledge, the statute should be construed to require proof of a more exacting mens rea, namely specific intent to sell.\nUnder section 2 of the former Penal Law, a person could be convicted as a principal if he “aid[ed] and abett[ed] in [the]commission [of a crime]”. The former Penal Law, however, did not specifically state what type of acts were required for conviction (see, Denzer & McQuillan, Practice Commentary, McKinney's Cons Law of NY, Book 39, Penal Law art 20, at 32 [1967]; 7 Zett, New York Criminal Practice ¶ 62.1 [2]). Consequently, in order to prevent the imposition of criminal liability for the principal's crime on someone who may have been merely present, the courts required proof that the aider or abetter “ 'share[d] the intent or purpose of the principal actor' ” (People v La Belle, 18 NY2d 405, 412, quoting 1 Burdick, Crimes § 221, at 297; see, People v Morhouse, 21 NY2d 66, 73-74 [accomplice had knowledge of and shared guilty purposes of principle]; People v Fasano, 11 NY2d 436, 443 [accomplice must be “engaged in a common purpose or design”]; see also, Comment, Jury Instructions in Aiding and Abetting Cases, 68 Colum L Rev 774, 777-780).\nDefendant's argument is that this “shared intent or purpose” test required proof, in his case, that he acted with the specific intent to sell cocaine. However, any lack of clarity that previously existed under section 2 of the former Penal Law was eliminated by the adoption of section 20.00 of the revised Penal Law, which specifies that an accomplice must have acted with the “mental culpability required for the commission” of the particular crime. Further, we have already construed section 20.00 as not requiring specific intent within the meaning of Penal Law § 15.05 (1) when the substantive crime does not involve such intent (see, People v Flayhart, 72 NY2d 737, 741). Finally, the “shared intent or purpose” language from our earlier cases, which appears occasionally even in cases arising under the modern statute (see, e.g., People v Allah, 71 NY2d 830, 831 [“community of purpose”]; People v Cummings, 131 AD2d 865; People v McLean, 107 AD2d 167, 169, affd 65 NY2d 758), cannot be read for the proposition, advanced by defendant, that a specific wish to commit the principal's substantive crime is required in all circumstances, including those involving substantive crimes with mental states other than that defined in Penal Law § 15.05 (1). Indeed, the “shared intent or purpose” test set forth in the case law merely establishes that acts undertaken in relative innocence and without a conscious design to advance the principal's crime will not support a conviction for accomplice liability. The same conclusion, however, is implicit in the specific requirement in Penal Law § 20.00 that the accomplice “solicit[ ], request [ ], command[ ], importune[ ], or intentionally aid[ ]” (emphasis added) the principal, since all of the delineated acts import goal-directed conduct (see, 7 Zett, New York Criminal Practice ¶ 62.1 [2])."

Thereafter, he built a house on Lot 2, which he sold, house and lot, to Baker. Consistent with the contract of sale and purchase, the deed conveying Lot 2 from Aris to Baker contained the following clause: In the event Baker, his heirs or assigns, decide to sell the property hereby conveyed and obtain a purchaser ready, willing, and able to purchase Lot 2 and the improvements thereon on terms and conditions acceptable to Baker, said Lot 2 and improvements shall be offered to Aris, his heirs or assigns, on the same terms and conditions. Aris, his heirs or assigns, as the case may be, shall have ten days from said offer to accept said offer and thereby to exercise said option. Three years after delivery and recording of the deed and payment of the purchase price, Baker became ill and moved to a climate more compatible with his health. Baker's daughter orally offered to purchase the premises from Baker at its then fair market value. Baker declined his daughter's offer but instead deeded Lot 2 to his daughter as a gift. Immediately thereafter, Baker's daughter sold Lot 2 to Charles at the then fair market value of Lot 2. The sale was completed by the delivery of deed and payment of the purchase price. At no time did Baker or his daughter offer to sell Lot 2 to Aris. Aris learned of the conveyance to Baker's daughter and the sale by Baker's daughter to Charles one week after the conveyance of Lot 2 from Baker's daughter to Charles. Aris promptly brought an appropriate action against Charles to enforce rights created in him by the deed of Aris to Baker. Aris tendered the amount paid by Charles into the court for whatever disposition the court deemed proper. The common-law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified by statute.

The supreme court in Montgomery limited the admission of earlier crimes as impeachment when it found that the defendant's 21–year–old conviction “bore no rational relationship to the defendant's present credibility, and should not have been admitted.” Montgomery, 47 Ill.2d at 511, 268 N.E.2d 695. The court adopted the then-proposed draft of the Federal Rule of Evidence 609. See Montgomery, 47 Ill.2d at 516, 268 N.E.2d 695; Cox, 195 Ill.2d at 383, 254 Ill.Dec. 720, 748 N.E.2d 166. Evidence of a past conviction could be admitted to attack the credibility of a witness, “ ‘but only if the crime, (1) was punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year * * * or (2) involved dishonesty or false statement regardless of the punishment unless (3), in either case, the judge determines that the probative value of the evidence of the crime is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.’ ” Montgomery, 47 Ill.2d at 516, 268 N.E.2d 695, quoting 51 F.R.D. 315, 391. Evidence of a conviction could not be admitted if more than 10 years had passed since the witness was convicted or released from confinement. Montgomery, 47 Ill.2d at 516, 268 N.E.2d 695. The third part of the test, balancing the probative value of an earlier conviction with its unfairly prejudicial effect, was considered to be the most important feature of the rule.  Montgomery, 47 Ill.2d at 517, 268 N.E.2d 695. The factors to be considered in the balancing test included the nature of the earlier crimes, the length of the defendant's criminal record, his age and circumstances, whether *970 it was more important for the jury to hear the defendant's version of the facts than to know of his earlier conviction, the nearness or remoteness of the earlier conviction, the defendant's career after the conviction and whether the earlier crime was similar to the one charged.

Probative value is the measure of the importance of that tendency to the outcome of a case. It is the weight that a piece of relevant evidence will carry in helping the trier of fact decide the issues. “[T]he more essential the evidence, the greater its probative value.” United States v. Stout, 509 F.3d 796, 804 (6th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, a court analyzing probative value considers the importance of the evidence and the significance of the issues to which the evidence relates. As our supreme court stated in State v. Torres, 390 S.C. 618, 703 S.E.2d 226 (2010), “[p]hotographs calculated to arouse the sympathy or prejudice of the jury should be excluded if they are ... not necessary to substantiate material facts or conditions.” 390 S.C. at 623, 703 S.E.2d at 228 (emphasis added).

Because the grand jury does not finally adjudicate guilt or innocence, it has traditionally been allowed to pursue its investigative and accusatorial functions unimpeded by the evidentiary and procedural restrictions applicable to a criminal trial.  Permitting witnesses to invoke the exclusionary rule before a grand jury would precipitate adjudication of issues hitherto reserved for the trial on the merits and would delay and disrupt grand jury proceedings. Suppression hearings would halt the orderly progress of an investigation and might necessitate extended litigation of issues only tangentially related to the grand jury's primary objective.

Public schools also receive other revenue from private gifts, federal grants, student fees, and local sales taxes. For many years, Green has distributed additional funds, which come from the state treasury, to local school districts in order to equalize the funds available on a per-student basis for each public school district.

It does not follow, however, that the defendant would be justified in using unreasonable force to compel the plaintiff to ‘get off’ the land merely because he was a trespasser. The use of a deadly weapon under such circumstances would be wholly unjustified. The mere fact that plaintiff was a trespasser would not justify the defendant in shooting in front of him or using the heavy gun as a club in an effort to eject him.  The rule applicable is stated in Eldred v. Burns et al., 182 Or. 394, 182 P.2d 397, 402, 188 P.2d 154, as follows: ‘A person aggrieved by a trespass may repel the intruder by such force as may be reasonably necessary, short of taking human life or causing great bodily harm; and if, while so doing, the trespasser commits any overt act giving the one aggrieved reasonable ground to believe himself in imminent danger of losing his life or receiving great bodily harm, he may in self-defense use a weapon, even to the extent of taking the life of his assailant, if reasonably necessary.

Hare, 194 Kan. 408, 412, 399 P.2d 543 (1965), defined a “condition precedent” as follows:\n“A condition precedent is something that it is agreed must happen or be performed before a right can accrue to enforce the main contract. It is one without *47 the performance of which the contract, although in form executed and delivered by the parties, cannot be enforced. A condition precedent requires the performance of some act or the happening of some event after the terms of the contract, including the condition precedent, have been agreed on before the contract shall take effect. [Citation omitted.]”\nThus, a condition precedent is simply “something that is agreed must happen or be performed before a right can occur to enforce the main contract.” Weinzirl v. The Wells Group, Inc., 234 Kan. 1016, Syl. ¶ 3, 677 P.2d 1004 (1984). Under our Supreme Court's definition, the presence of a condition precedent does not stymie the formation of a contract, but rather becomes part of the contract itself. “When all terms of a contract have been agreed upon and a condition precedent to requiring performance is accepted, the condition precedent becomes part of the main contract and the agreement is consummated.” Wallerius v. Hare, 200 Kan. 578, Syl. ¶ 1, 438 P.2d 65 (1968).\n Courts have recognized two types of conditions precedent: conditions precedent to performance under an existing contract and conditions precedent to the formation of a contract. “In the law of contracts, conditions may relate to the existence of contracts or to the duty of immediate performance under them. Thus, there may be conditions to the formation of a contract, or conditions to performance of a contract.” Richard A. Lord, A 13 Lord, Williston on Contracts, § 38:4, p. 375 (4th ed. 2000). Conditions precedent to performance under an existing contract arise from the terms of a valid contract and define an event that must occur before a right or obligation matures under the contract. In contrast, conditions precedent to the formation of a contract involve issues of offer and acceptance which precede and determine the formation of a contract. City of Haverhill v. George Brox, Inc.; Gordon Construction Corporation, 47 Mass.App.Ct. 717, 719–20, 716 N.E.2d 138 (1999) (citing Corbin on Contracts § 628 [1960 & Supp. 1999]; 5 Williston on Contracts § 666A [3d ed. 1961 & Supp. 1999]; Restatement [Second] of Contracts § 224 [1979] )."

Hence it is preferable not to rely upon that misleading expression for an understanding of murder but rather to consider the various types of murder (typed according to the mental element) which the common law came to recognize and which exist today in most jurisdictions:\n“(1) intent-to-kill murder;\n“(2) intent-to-do-serious-bodily-injury murder;\n“(3) depraved-heart murder (wanton and willful disregard that the natural tendency of the defendant's behavior is to cause death or great bodily harm); and\n“(4) felony murder.” \nUnder the common law, which we refer to in defining murder in this state, each of the four types of murder noted above has its own mental element which independently satisfies the requirement of malice aforethought."

At Bower's request, Cash mailed a signed letter to Geetus: \"If you lend $1,000 to my daughter, I will repay it if she doesn't.\" On September 15, Geetus, having read Cash's letter, lent $1,000 to Bower, which Bower agreed to repay in installments of $100 plus accrued interest on the last day of each month beginning October 31.

If the answer is no, the employee has no First Amendment cause of action based on his or her employer's reaction to the speech. See Connick, supra, at 147, 103 S.Ct. 1684. If the answer is yes, then the possibility of a First Amendment claim arises.

See Pickering, 391 U.S., at 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731. This consideration reflects the importance of the relationship between the speaker's expressions and employment.

The ordinance further provides that the purchase of a cemetery lot entitles the owner to perpetual care of the lot, and entitles the owner to erect on the lot, at the owner's expense, a memorial monument or marker of the owner's choice, subject to certain size restrictions. The Metro City ordinance requires the city to maintain the cemetery, including mowing the grass, watering flowers, and plowing snow, and provides for the expenditure of city tax funds for such maintenance if revenues from the sale of cemetery lots are insufficient. Although cemetery lots are sold at full fair market value, which includes the current value of perpetual care, the revenue from the sale of such lots has been insufficient in recent years to maintain the cemetery.

    "question": "Dooley was a pitcher for the City Robins, a professional baseball team. While Dooley was throwing warm-up pitches on the sidelines during a game, he was continuously heckled by some spectators seated in the stands above the dugout behind a wire mesh fence. On several occasions, Dooley turned and looked directly at the hecklers with a scowl on his face, but the heckling continued. Dooley wound up as though he was preparing to pitch in the direction of his catcher; however the ball traveled from his hand at high speed, at a 90-degree angle from the line to the catcher and directly toward the hecklers in the stands. The ball passed through the wire mesh fence and struck Patricia, one of the hecklers. Patricia brought an action for damages against Dooley and the City Robins, based upon negligence and battery. The trial court directed a verdict for the defendants on the battery count. The jury found for the defendants on the negligence count because the jury determined that Dooley could not foresee that the ball would pass through the wire mesh fence. Patricia has appealed the judgments on the battery counts, contending that the trial court erred in directing verdicts for Dooley and the City Robins. For this question only, assume that, on appeal, the court holds that the question of whether Dooley committed a battery is a jury issue.

Fano, 427 U.S. at 224, 96 S.Ct., at 2538. Due process is required only when a decision of the State implicates an interest within the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment. And “to determine whether due process requirements apply in the first place, we must look not to the ‘weight’ but to the nature of the interest at stake.” Roth, supra, 408 U.S., at 570-571, 92 S.Ct., at 2705.\n The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, later incorporated into the Fourteenth, was intended to give Americans *673 at least the protection against governmental power that they had enjoyed as Englishmen against the power of the Crown. The liberty preserved from deprivation without due process included the right “generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.” Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399, 43 S.Ct. 625, 626, 67 L.Ed. 1042 (1923); see Dent v. West Virginia, 129 U.S. 114, 123-124, 9 S.Ct. 231, 233-234, 32 L.Ed. 623 (1889). Among the historic liberties so protected was a right to be free from and to obtain judicial relief, for unjustified intrusions on personal security.41\nWhile the contours of this historic liberty interest in the context of our federal system of government have not been defined precisely,42 they always have been thought **1414 to encompass *674 freedom from bodily restraint and punishment. See Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 72 S.Ct. 205, 96 L.Ed. 183 (1952). It is fundamental that the state cannot hold and physically punish an individual except in accordance with due process of law.\nThis constitutionally protected liberty interest is at stake in this case. There is, of course a de minimis level of imposition with which the Constitution is not concerned. But at least where school authorities, acting under color of state law, deliberately decide to punish a child for misconduct by restraining the child and inflicting appreciable physical pain, we hold that Fourteenth Amendment liberty interests are implicated."

Any state employee who is dismissed after that five-year period must be given reasons for the dismissal before it takes effect. In addition, such an employee must, upon request, be granted a postdismissal hearing before an administrative board to seek reinstatement and back pay. The statute precludes any other hearing or opportunity to respond to the charges. That post-dismissal hearing must occur within six months after the dismissal takes effect. The burden of proof at such a hearing is on the state, and the board may uphold the dismissal only if it is supported by a preponderance of the evidence. An employee who is dissatisfied with a decision of the board after a hearing may appeal its decision to the state courts. The provisions of this statute are inseverable. A teacher who had been employed continuously for seven years as a faculty member at the state university was dismissed. A week before the dismissal took effect, she was informed that she was being dismissed because of a charge that she accepted a bribe from a student in return for raising the student's final grade in her course. At that time she requested an immediate hearing to contest the propriety of her dismissal. Three months after her dismissal, she was granted a hearing before the state administrative board. The board upheld her dismissal, finding that the charge against her was supported by a preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing.

Dora decided to raze the existing building on her lot and to erect a building of greater height. Dora has received all governmental approvals required to pursue her project. There is no applicable statute or ordinance (other than those dealing with various approvals for zoning, building, etc.). Assume that no problems with subsidence or other misadventures occurred during construction of Dora's new building. However, when it was completed, Pam discovered that the shadow created by the new higher building placed her building in such deep shade that her ability to lease space was diminished and that the rent she could charge and the occupancy rate were substantially lower. Assume that these facts are proved in an appropriate action Pam instituted against Dora for all and any relief available.

But this right of lateral support extends only to the soil in its natural condition. It does not protect whatever is placed upon the soil increasing the downward and lateral pressure. If it did, it would put it in the power of a lot-owner, by erecting heavy buildings on his lot, to greatly abridge the right of his neighbor to use his lot.

Id. ch. 6 Special Note on Proximate Cause, at 574. Although the “substantial factor” requirement has frequently been understood to apply to proximate cause determinations, see Gerst, 549 N.W.2d at 815–16, the drafters contend it was never intended to do so. Restatement (Third) § 29 cmt. a, at 576.3 Accordingly, to eliminate the resulting confusion of factual and policy determinations resulting from the Restatement (Second) formulation of legal cause, the drafters have opted to address factual cause and scope of liability (proximate cause) separately. Restatement (Third) ch. 6 Special Note on Proximate Cause, at 575. The assessment of scope of liability under the Restatement (Third) no longer includes a determination of whether the actor's conduct was a substantial factor in causing the harm at issue, a question properly addressed under the *838 factual cause rubric. See id. § 27 cmt. j, at 427–29.4\nMost importantly, the drafters of the Restatement (Third) have clarified the essential role of policy considerations in the determination of the scope of liability. “An actor's liability is limited to those physical harms that result from the risks that made the actor's conduct tortious.” Id. § 29, at 575.  This principle, referred to as the “risk standard,” is intended to prevent the unjustified imposition of liability by “confining liability's scope to the reasons for holding the actor liable in the first place.” Id. § 29 cmt. d, at 579–80. As an example of the standard's application, the drafters provide an illustration of a hunter returning from the field and handing his loaded shotgun to a child as he enters the house. Id. cmt. d, illus. 3, at 581. The child drops the gun (an object assumed for the purposes of the illustration to be neither too heavy nor unwieldy for a child of that age and size to handle) which lands on her foot and breaks her toe. Id. Applying the risk standard described above, the hunter would not be liable for the broken toe because the risk that made his action negligent was the risk that the child would shoot someone, not that she would drop the gun and sustain an injury to her foot. Id.\nThe scope-of-liability issue is fact-intensive as it requires consideration of the risks that made the actor's conduct tortious and a determination of whether the harm at issue is a result of any of those risks. Id. § 29 cmt. d, at 580, 584. When, as in this case, the court considers in advance of trial whether the plaintiff's harm is beyond the scope of liability as a matter of law, courts must initially consider all of the range of harms risked by the defendant's conduct that the jury could find as the basis for determining [the defendant's] conduct tortious. Then, the court can compare the plaintiff's harm with the range of harms risked by the defendant to determine whether a reasonable jury might find the former among the latter.\nId. at 580."

Larson suffers from a neurological problem that makes it impossible for him to remember an occurrence for longer than 48 hours. After Larson was charged, the police visited him and asked if they might search his home. Larson consented. The police found a diary written by Larson. An entry dated the same day as the victim's disappearance read, \"Indescribable excitement. Why did no one ever tell me that killing gave such pleasure to the master?\" Larson was charged with murder. His attorney has moved to exclude the diary from evidence on the ground that its admission would violate Larson's privilege against self-incrimination. Counsel has also argued that Larson could not give informed consent to the search because more than 48 hours had passed since the making of the entry and hence he could not remember the existence of the incriminating entry at the time he gave his consent.

    "question": "Blackacre is a large tract of land owned by a religious order known as The Seekers. On Blackacre, The Seekers erected a large residential building where its members reside. Blackacre is surrounded by rural residential properties and its only access to a public way is afforded by an easement over a strip of land 30 feet wide. The easement was granted to The Seekers by deed from Sally, the owner of one of the adjacent residential properties. The Seekers built a driveway on the strip, and the easement was used for 20 years without incident or objection. Last year, as permitted by the applicable zoning ordinance, The Seekers constructed a 200-bed nursing home and a parking lot on Blackacre, using all of Blackacre that was available for such development. The nursing home was very successful, and on Sundays visitors to the nursing home overflowed the parking facilities on Blackacre and parked all along the driveway from early in the morning through the evening hours. After two Sundays of the resulting congestion and inconvenience, Sally erected a barrier across the driveway on Sundays preventing any use of the driveway by anyone seeking access to Blackacre. The Seekers objected. Sally brought an appropriate action to terminate the easement. The most likely result in this action is that the court will hold for",

When interpreting the terms of a written easement, the court must follow the ordinary rules of contract construction so as to carry out the intent of the parties as demonstrated by the language in the contract. Lakewood Homes v. BP Oil, Inc. 11th District No. 5–98–29, 1999–Ohio–851 citing Skivoloski v. East Ohio Gas Company, 38 Ohio St.2d 244, 313 N.E.2d 374 (1974), syllabus, paragraph one. If the question is the scope of an easement, the court must look to the language of the easement to determine the extent. If there is no specific delineation of the easement, or if the document is ambiguous, then the court must look to the surrounding circumstances in order to determine the intent of the parties. Murray v. Lyon, 95 Ohio App.3d 215, 219, 642 N.E.2d 41 (1994). The language of the easement, coupled with the surrounding circumstances, is the best indication of the extent and limitations of the easement. Apel v. Katz, 83 Ohio St.3d 11, 17, 1998–Ohio420, 697 N.E.2d 600.

Rule 701's requirement that the opinion be “rationally based on the perception of the witness” demands more than that the witness have perceived something firsthand; rather, it requires that the witness's perception provide a truly rational basis for his or her opinion. Similarly, the second requirement—that the opinion be “helpful to a clear understanding of the witness's testimony or the determination of a fact in issue”—demands more than that the opinion have a bearing on the issues in the case; in order to be “helpful,” an opinion must be reasonably reliable. In other words, Rule 701 requires that a lay opinion witness have a reasonable basis grounded either in experience or specialized knowledge for arriving at the opinion that he or she expresses.

The trial court's finding on the question of causation was supported by evidence that prior to 1978 both properties possessed satisfactory drainage systems; at no time prior to 1978 did water from defendants' property *415 drain onto plaintiffs' property. Notwithstanding knowledge that the motorcycles were trespassing the defendants failed to take measures to stop the activity. The berms on defendants' property broke down as a result of the trespassing.\n Defendants say the trial court erred in finding they were under a duty to inspect their property. They cite Kozloski v. Modern Litho, Inc., 182 Neb. 270, 154 N.W.2d 460, 463 (1967). A better characterization of the trial court's holding would be that the defendants owed a duty to plaintiffs to take reasonable measures to maintain artificial conditions on their property and that, in the light of facts within their knowledge, inspection was one such reasonable measure. Kozloski held a landowner is under no independent duty to inspect property in the absence of knowledge suggesting an inspection. This seems to be consistent with the standard which the trial court here applied to defendants. Since defendants knew that motorcycle traffic was damaging their property it seems only reasonable that they should have inspected it to assess the situation and thereafter correct the damaged embankment. The trial court did not err in making this finding."

However, where a defendant acknowledges statements of an accomplice, the acknowledged statements become the defendant's own confession by ratification or adoption and are admissible against the defendant, despite their claim that the inculpating remarks are hearsay.\nA statement by a codefendant who is granted a separate trial may not be read into evidence at the trial of the other codefendant, where the party against whom it is offered has not had the opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination, to satisfy the right of confrontation.4 The United States Supreme Court has found that a nontestifying accomplice's confession which inculpates a criminal defendant is not within a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule as that concept has been defined by Confrontation Clause jurisprudence. Thus, a nontestifying accomplice's confession, in which they incriminate themselves as well as the defendant, is not sufficiently reliable to be admissible without allowing the defendant to cross-examine the accomplice, even though other evidence at trial corroborates portions of the accomplice's statements, the police have informed the accomplice of their Miranda rights and have not promised them leniency in exchange for their statements, and the accomplice knows they are exposing themselves to criminal liability.5"

    "question": "The state of Orrington wanted to prevent its only major league baseball team, the privately owned and operated Orrington Opossums, from moving to the rival state of Atrium. After a heated political debate in the legislature, Orrington enacted legislation providing for a one-time grant of $10 million in state funds to the Opossums to cover part of the projected income losses the team would suffer during the next five years if it remained in that state. The legislation required that the team remain in the state for at least ten years if it accepted the grant. After accepting the grant, the owners of the Opossums decided to build a new $150 million stadium in Orrington. As plans for the construction of the new stadium proceeded, it became evident that all of the contractors and subcontractors would be white males, and that they had been chosen by the owners of the Opossums without any public bids because these contractors and subcontractors had successfully built the only other new baseball stadium in the region. Several contractors who were females or members of minority racial groups filed suit against the owners of the Opossums in federal district court to compel public solicitation of bids for the construction of its new stadium on an equal opportunity basis, and to enjoin construction of the stadium until compliance was ensured.

After the surgery, Surgeon performed a test that showed that Patient's fallopian tubes were not severed, as was necessary for sterilization. Surgeon did not reveal the failure of the operation to Patient, who three years later became pregnant and delivered a baby afflicted with a severe birth defect that will require substantial medical care throughout its life. The birth defect resulted from a genetic defect unknown to, and undiscoverable by, Surgeon.

    "ctx": "To place the issue presented in the certified question in proper context, we initially review some basic relevant concepts of compensatory damages.  Generally, a tort plaintiff is entitled to all damages proximately caused by a wrongdoer's actions. “The basic goal in awarding damages is to fairly and adequately compensate the plaintiff for the injuries and losses sustained.” Flannery v. U.S., 171 W.Va. 27, 29, 297 S.E.2d 433, 435 (1982). Thus, “the aim of compensatory damages is to restore a plaintiff to the financial position he/she would presently enjoy but for the defendant's injurious conduct.” Kessel v. Leavitt, 204 W.Va. 95, 187, 511 S.E.2d 720, 812 (1998).\nTo fulfill this overarching goal of making an injured party whole, compensatory damages include not only actual losses but also the anticipated losses due to the future effects of an injury caused by negligence. **463 *357 Future damages are “awarded to an injured party for, among other things: (1) Residuals or future effects of an injury which have reduced the capability of an individual to function as a whole man; (2) future pain and suffering; (3) loss or impairment of earning capacity; and (4) future medical expenses.” Syl. Pt. 10, Jordan v. Bero, 158 W.Va. 28, 210 S.E.2d 618 (1974). In syllabus point seven of Jordan we formally adopted the test, first articulated in Wilson v. Fleming, 89 W.Va. 553, 109 S.E. 810 (1921), for recovering future damages:\nTo form a legal basis for recovery of future permanent consequences of the negligent infliction of a personal injury, it must appear with reasonable certainty that such consequences will result from the injury; contingent or merely possible future injurious effects are too remote and speculative to support a lawful recovery."

He was unaware of Sam's possession, his quitclaim deed, or his relationship to Orben. Fred promptly and properly recorded his deed and began removing timber from the land. Immediately upon learning of Fred's actions, Sam recorded his deed and brought an appropriate action to enjoin Fred from removing the timber and to quiet title in Sam.

At Whiteacre, Agency has operated a waste-to-electricity recycling facility for 12 years. Blackacre and Whiteacre are in a remote area and Whiteacre is the only developed parcel of real estate within a ten-mile radius. The boundary line between Blackacre and Whiteacre had never been surveyed or marked on the face of the earth. During the past 12 years, some of the trucks bringing waste to the Agency facility have dumped their loads so that the piles of waste extend from Whiteacre onto a portion of Blackacre. However, prior to the four-week period during each calendar year when the Agency facility is closed for inspection and repairs, the waste piles are reduced to minimal levels so that during each of the four-week closures no waste was, in fact, piled on Blackacre. Neither Brown nor any representative of Agency knew the facts about the relation of the boundary line to the waste piles. The time for acquiring title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is ten years. Last year, Brown died, and his son, Silas, succeeded him as the owner of Blackacre.

A statute in the jurisdiction provides: \"Any judgment properly filed shall, for ten years from filing, be a lien on the real property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person against whom the judgment is rendered.\" The recording act of the jurisdiction authorizes recording of contracts and also provides: \"No conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value and without notice unless the same be recorded according to law.\" There are no other relevant statutory provisions. At the closing, Baker declined to accept the title of Able on the ground that Charlie's judgment lien encumbered the title he would receive and rendered it unmarketable.

It was neither pretextual nor commercially unreasonable for buyer of mobile home to reject seller's delivery of manufacturer's certificate of origin at closing as imperfect tender, where parties' contract unambiguously stated that title, not certificate, was due at closing, and seller's delivery of certificate required buyer to pay sales tax, thereby adding $1,806 to buyer's contractual obligation."

Under this principle, the tortfeasor is responsible for the full extent of the plaintiff's damages even if those injuries would not have occurred but for the plaintiff's pre-existing physical condition, disease, or susceptibility to injury. Although her “pre-existing” condition is not a physical condition or illness as with the ordinary eggshell plaintiff, she argues that the same rule should apply. We disagree. The eggshell plaintiff principle concerns the amount or extent of damages recoverable from the defendant due to his negligence when the plaintiff has pre-existing injuries. It does not ease or lessen the plaintiff's burden of showing that the defendant's breach was a legal cause of her injury. Even if the eggshell plaintiff rule applied to NIED cases where there are no physical injuries, the defendant's conduct is judged under an objective standard, i.e., the effect such conduct would have on a person of ordinary sensibilities, unless the defendant knew or should have known that the plaintiff is particularly susceptible to emotional distress. Knight's negligence in this case would ordinarily result in little more than annoyance to the victim. Therefore, there is no “ease of association” between the harm claimed, i.e., severe emotional distress, and the conduct of Knight."

That the observation from aircraft was directed at identifying the plants and the officers were trained to recognize marijuana is irrelevant. Such observation is precisely what a judicial officer needs to provide a basis for a warrant.

Such cases will arise only when the acts of the defendant are “marked by uncommon brutality—coupled not with an intent to kill ... but with depraved indifference to the victim's plight” (Payne, 3 N.Y.3d at 271, 786 N.Y.S.2d 116, 819 N.E.2d 634). To constitute depraved indifference, the defendant's “conduct must be ‘ “so wanton, so deficient in a moral sense of concern, so devoid of regard of the life or lives of others, and so blameworthy as to warrant the same criminal liability as that which the law imposes upon a person who intentionally causes the death of another” ’ ” (People v.

As part of that program, the state limits, by statute, oyster fishing in its coastal waters to persons who have state oyster permits. In order to promote conservation, it issues only a limited number of oyster permits each year. The permits are effective for only one year from the date of their issuance and are awarded on the basis of a lottery, in which there is no differentiation between resident and nonresident applicants. However, each nonresident who obtains a permit is charged an annual permit fee that is $5 more than the fee charged residents. Fisher, Inc., is a large fishing company that operates from a port in another state and is incorporated in that other state. Each of the boats of Fisher, Inc., has a federal shipping license that permits it \"to engage in all aspects of the coastal trade, to fish and to carry cargo from place to place along the coast, and to engage in other lawful activities along the coast of the United States.\" These shipping licenses are authorized by federal statute. Assume no other federal statutes or administrative rules apply. Although it had previously held an Atlantica oyster permit, Fisher, Inc., did not obtain a permit in that state's lottery this year.

    "question": "Oscar purchased a large bottle of No-Flake dandruff shampoo, manufactured by Shampoo Company. The box containing the bottle stated in part: \"CAUTION--Use only 1 capful at most once a day. Greater use may cause severe damage to the scalp.\" Oscar read the writing on the box, removed the bottle, and threw the box away. Oscar's roommate, Paul, asked to use the No-Flake, and Oscar said, \"Be careful not to use too much.\" Paul thereafter used No-Flake twice a day, applying two or three capfuls each time, notwithstanding the label statement that read: \"Use no more than one capful per day. See box instructions.\" The more he used No-Flake, the more inflamed his scalp became, the more it itched, and the more he used. After three weeks of such use, Paul finally consulted a doctor who diagnosed his problem as a serious and irreversible case of dermatitis caused by excessive exposure to the active ingredients in No-Flake. These ingredients are uniquely effective at controlling dandruff, but there is no way to remove a remote risk to a small percentage of persons who may contract dermatitis as the result of applying for prolonged periods of time amounts of No-Flake substantially in excess of the directions. This jurisdiction adheres to the traditional common-law rules pertaining to contributory negligence and assumption of risk. If Paul asserts a claim for his injuries against Shampoo Company based on strict liability in tort, which of the following would constitute a defense? I. Paul misused the No-Flake shampoo. II.

Wade, including “a recognition of the right of the woman to choose to have an abortion before viability and to obtain it without undue interference from the State,” and “the principle that the State has legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the fetus that may become a child.” Casey recognizes the right of a woman to have an abortion before viability, but this is not an absolute right. The state may interfere with that right, provided that the interference is not undue, that is, that it does not create a substantial obstacle to a woman's decision to exercise her right. “A finding of an undue burden is a shorthand for the conclusion that a state regulation has the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus. A statute with this purpose is invalid because the means chosen by the State to further the interest in potential life must be calculated to inform the woman's free choice, not hinder it.”"

A statute of the state of Magenta requires occupants of residences with basements susceptible to the intrusion of radon to have their residences tested for the presence of radon and to take specified remedial steps if the test indicates the presence of radon above specified levels. The statute also provides that the testing for radon may be done only by testers licensed by a state agency. According to the statute, a firm may be licensed to test for radon only if it meets specified rigorous standards relating to the accuracy of its testing. These standards may easily be achieved with current technology; but the technology required to meet them is 50% more expensive than the technology required to measure radon accumulations in a slightly less accurate manner. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) does not license radon testers. However, a federal statute authorizes the EPA to advise on the accuracy of various methods of radon testing and to provide to the general public a list of testers that use methods it believes to be reasonably accurate. WeTest, a recently established Magenta firm, uses a testing method that the EPA has stated is reasonably accurate. WeTest is also included by the EPA on the list of testers using methods of testing it believes to be reasonably accurate. WeTest applies for a Magenta radon testing license, but its application is denied because WeTest cannot demonstrate that the method of testing for radon it uses is sufficiently accurate to meet the rigorous Magenta statutory standards.

    "question": "Alice owned a commercial property, Eastgate, consisting of a one-story building rented to various retail stores and a very large parking lot. Two years ago, Alice died and left Eastgate to her nephew, Paul, for life, with remainder to her godson, Richard, his heirs and assigns. Paul was 30 years old and Richard was 20 years old when Alice died. The devise of Eastgate was made subject to any mortgage on Eastgate in effect at the time of Alice's death. When Alice executed her will, the balance of the mortgage debt on Eastgate was less than $5,000. A year before her death, Alice suffered financial reverses; and in order to meet her debts, she had mortgaged Eastgate to secure a loan of $150,000. The entire principal of the mortgage remained outstanding when she died. As a result, the net annual income from Eastgate was reduced not only by real estate taxes and regular maintenance costs, but also by the substantial mortgage interest payments that were due each month. Paul was very dissatisfied with the limited benefit that he was receiving from the life estate. When, earlier this year, Acme, Inc., proposed to purchase Eastgate, demolish the building, pay off the mortgage, and construct a 30-story office building, Paul was willing to accept Acme's offer. However, Richard adamantly refused the offer, even though Richard, as the remainderman, paid the principal portion of each monthly mortgage amortization payment. Richard was independently wealthy and wanted to convert Eastgate into a public park when he became entitled to possession. When Acme realized that Richard would not change his mind, Acme modified its proposal to a purchase of the life estate of Paul. Acme was ready to go ahead with its building plans, relying upon a large life insurance policy on Paul's life to protect it against the economic risk of Paul's death. Paul's life expectancy was 45 years. When Richard learned that Paul had agreed to Acme's modified proposal, Richard brought an appropriate action against them to enjoin their carrying it out.

Because the jurors and the trial judge were in a position to evaluate any relevant questions of fact, the appellate court gives deference to those issues and assumes they were decided correctly. To win on appeal, you must show that the errors were “prejudicial”\nBut determining that there was a legal error is not enough by itself to overturn a conviction or sentence.  The appellate court must additionally conclude that the error prejudiced one of the parties.  “Prejudice” is shown when there is a reasonable probability that the legal error made a difference in the outcome of the case.

The reason the taxes on Owner's home are higher than those imposed on the other similar homes in similar neighborhoods is that she bought her home much more recently than the other owners and, therefore, it is assessed at a much higher \"actual value\" than their homes.

Anyone who assisted the man with the gun can be considered an accomplice. So the person driving the getaway car, the guy holding the door open, and the person that provides the safe house after the crime is committed can all be seen as accomplices. These people all helped or encouraged the bank robber and so are guilty as accomplices even though they didn’t technically commit the underlying crime.\nBecause of the work of multiple people to commit a crime, accomplice liability is commonly confused with conspiracy. The two crimes differ in that in conspiracy, there is an agreement to commit a crime. Accomplice liability does not have an agreement, it sort of just happens. Once an agreement is made, it is likely that a person would be charged with conspiracy rather than being an accomplice.\nLegally, an accomplice has the same degree of guilt as the person who received his or her assistance.

Hinckley, concerning the assassination attempt against then-President Ronald Reagan.\nCompetency \nAn important procedural corollary to the insanity defense involves the establishment of legal competency, otherwise known as competence to stand trial. In accordance with due process requirements, a criminal defendant cannot stand trial if he or she is deemed legally incompetent. As articulated by the Supreme Court in Dusky, a defendant is incompetent if he or she is incapable of rationally communicating with his or her attorney or rationally comprehending the nature of the proceedings against him or her. A defendant may move at any time for a hearing to determine competency, which involves the submission of supporting evidence and some form of a psychological evaluation. The threshold for establishing competency is often identified as notoriously low. So long as a defendant is deemed incompetent, the insanity defense becomes moot as the defendant cannot stand trial.\nThe ''M'Naghten Rule''  \nThe first famous legal test for insanity came in 1843, in the M'Naghten case. Englishman Daniel M'Naghten shot and killed the secretary of the British Prime Minister, believing that the Prime Minister was conspiring against him. The court acquitted M'Naghten \"by reason of insanity,\" and he was placed in a mental institution for the rest of his life. However, the case caused a public uproar, and Queen Victoria ordered the court to develop a stricter test for insanity.\nThe \"M'Naghten rule\" was a standard to be applied by the jury, after hearing medical testimony from prosecution and defense experts. The rule created a presumption of sanity unless the defense proved \"at the time of committing the act, the accused was laboring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing or, if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong.\"\nThis analysis focuses on an actor's cognition. The test is bifurcated into two components, each of which is individually sufficient to substantiate an insanity defense. First, a defendant is deemed insane if they were incapable of knowing what they were doing at the time committing the object offense. This conclusion comports with criminal law's fundamental conception of culpability. A defendant is not culpable for an act that, because of a psychological infirmity, he or she did not know he or she was committing.\nThe second component of the test looks to determine if the defendant knew that his or her actions were wrong. Here, even if the defendant knew what he or she was doing, he or she is deemed insane where he or she was incapable of recognizing the wrongfulness of the action committed. A paradigmatic example of this analysis involves deific decrees. In these cases, the defendant is often found insane on the grounds that, because \"God\" commanded the defendant to act, he or she was unable to recognize the wrongfulness of the act that was carried out. \nVarious legal commentaries have identified theoretical issues within the M'Naghten framework. For example, a scholarly debate exists addressing whether the \"wrongfulness\" central to the M'Naghten analysis comprises tenets of legality or morality. Another prominent criticism takes objection to the categorical approach the M'Naghten test employs. By focusing exclusively on cognitive incapacity, the M'Naghten test is not well suited for treating more nuanced forms of psychological disorders, particularly those involving volitional impairment. Traditionally, the M'Naghten test has been associated with schizophrenia and psychotic disorders.\nThe M'Naghten rule became the standard for insanity in the United States and the United Kingdom and is still the standard for insanity in almost half of the states.\nThe \"Irresistible Impulse\" Test \nIn contrast to the emphasis on cognition central to the M'Naghten test, the \"Irresistible Impulse\" test focuses on the volitional components of insanity. Various courts have struggled to address criminal defendants who, while comprehending the wrongfulness of their actions, are incapable of self-control because of a mental disease or defect. To levy punishment against a defendant unable to control his actions appears at odds with the preeminent tenets of criminal justice. The move towards volition alleviates this tension. Under the \"Irresistible Impulse\" test a jury may find a defendant not guilty by reason of insanity where the defendant was laboring under a mental disease or defect that compelled him to commit the object offense. This test is well-suited for persons suffering from manias and paraphilias.While treating a genuine issue within the M'Naghten framework, the \"Irresistible Impulse\" test creates several practical concerns. First, unlike the cognitive prong of the insanity defense, the volitional component of insanity is substantiated by a less robust scientific literature. Consequently, the evaluating the veracity of a defendant's claim becomes more difficult in the absence of unequivocal scientific findings. Moreover, the \"Irresistible Impulse\" test may be over-inclusive. Defendants laboring under psychological conditions, which, while genuine, do not completely inhibit self-control, may be exonerated of criminal liability. \nThe Durham Rule (The \"Product\" Test) \nMonte Durham was a 23-year-old who had been in and out of prison and mental institutions since he was 17. He was convicted for housebreaking in 1953, and his attorney appealed. Although the district court judge had ruled that Durham's attorneys had failed to prove he didn't know the difference between right and wrong, the federal appellate judge chose to use the case to reform the M'Naghten rule. Citing leading psychiatrists and jurists of the day, the appellate judge stated that the M'Naghten rule was based on \"an entirely obsolete and misleading conception of the nature of insanity.\" The court of appeals overturned Durham's conviction and established a new rule. The Durham rule states \"that an accused is not criminally responsible if his unlawful act was the product of mental disease or mental defect.\" \nThe implementation of this test was initially seen as a progressive development. Specifically, the Durham rule moved away from legal formalisms and emphasized scientific psychological evaluations and evidence. This approach emphasized expert testimony and largely left the jury to follow the professional opinions provided. So long as a professional concluded that the defendant was subject to a mental disease, a finding of insanity likely followed.  \nProblems quickly emerged, however, and the Durham test fell out of favor. First, the test revealed itself to be frequently conclusory and deprived the jury of their decision-making role. A finding of insanity was left to the discretionary findings of trained professionals who were largely unrestricted in their methodological approach. The lack of any clear definition for essential terms like \"mental disease or defect\" exacerbated this issue and led to inconsistency as different professionals came to disparate conclusions. Moreover, the test proved over-inclusive. Under the \"product\" approach, defendants could be found not guilty by reason of insanity even where they understood and had control over their actions at the time of the offense. For these individuals, punishment may be more appropriate as its deterrent effect remains intact. Consequently, the same D.C. circuit that adopted the test in 1954, rejected the test in 1972 when deciding the Brawner case. New Hampshire is now the only jurisdiction that employs a test similar to the Durham rule.\nThe Model Penal Code \nIn 1972, in an attempt to modernize the legal standard for insanity, the American Law Institute, a panel of legal experts, developed a new rule for insanity as part of the Model Penal Code. This rule, found in § 4.01 of the Code, says that a defendant is not responsible for criminal conduct where (s)he, as a result of mental disease or defect, did not possess a \"substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.\"\nSection 4.01 of the Code represents a concerted effort to reconcile the various details and emphases present in the traditional tests for insanity. First, the language, \"appreciate,\" addresses the cognitive component central to the M'Naghten analysis. Unlike the oft rigid M'Naghten test, however, the \"appreciate\" language of § 4.01 is broad and intended to realistically address the graded nuances of mental disabilities. Moreover, the rule allows the legislature to choose between the language of \"criminality\" or \"wrongfulness.\" This presentation allows legislatures to choose between a more legalistic conception of wrong, in the form of \"criminality,\" or a broader, morally infused understanding, in the form of \"wrongfulness.\" The evaluation of \"wrongfulness\" or \"criminality\" is complex and intricate. Complications arise, for example, when considering persons who, although knowing society would condemn their acts as wrong or criminal, believe that this would not be the case if society knew what they were \"aware\" of.\nThe second component of § 4.01 comprises a volition-based analysis. This aspect of the Model Penal Code's insanity standard reflects the theoretical foundation supporting the \"Irresistible Impulse\" test. Here, the Code dictates that criminal liability is unjustified where a defendant could not  \"conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.\" This emphasis on conformity looks to provide for those persons cognizant of their wrongful act, but unable, because of some mental disease or defect, to control themselves. The inclusion of this volitional analysis, alongside a cognitive analysis, represents the progressive nature of the insanity standard developed in the Model Penal Code.\nFinally, of particular import is § 4.01(2) of the Code. There, the use of the insanity defense for psychopaths and sociopaths is expressly proscribed."

First, the assignor can simply notify the assignee that the assignor revokes the assignment. In our scenario, Green would simply tell Orange that he's changed his mind.\nSecond, the assignor can revoke the assignment by directly accepting the obligor's performance. In our scenario, Green would accept the $20 from Yellow rather than having Yellow pay Orange.\nThird, the assignor can make a subsequent assignment of the same right to another party. In our scenario, this means that after assigning Orange the right to collect $20 from Yellow, Green would assign Blue the right to collect $20 from Yellow. The subsequent assignment to Blue automatically revokes the assignment to Orange.\nLastly, the assignment will be automatically revoked as a matter of law if the assignor dies or declares bankruptcy. In our scenario, let's say that Green declares bankruptcy shortly after assigning his rights to Orange. If Orange hasn't received the $20 yet, then the assignment will be automatically revoked."

    "ctx": "In examining the extent or scope of the contact-sports exception, we recognize a sport involving contact between participants or contact with instruments or objects used by participants provides knowledge and understanding to the participants of the inherent risks of harm that can be created. This applies not only by the conduct that occurs within the rules and objectives of the sport, but also by conduct from participants who fail to properly execute an activity contemplated by the sport. See Leonard, 601 N.W.2d at 79 (recognizing that participants in athletic events voluntarily endure “risks normally associated with the activity”). As we observed in Leonard, the violation of a sport's rules creates a risk of injury to participants that would not necessarily exist without the infraction, such as when players run into punters in football, midfielders are high-sticked in lacrosse, basketball players are fouled, batters are hit by pitched balls in baseball, and hockey players are tripped. Id. at 80. Yet, such contact is nevertheless inherent in each game because no participant can play the game error free. Thus, players accept risks of harm inherent in a sport both derived from activities that are executed as contemplated by the sport and activities that are improperly executed. For example, a base runner in softball can be struck and injured by a ball hit by a batter or can be struck and injured by a wild throw from a fielder. In both instances, the risk of harm from contact is inherent in the game, even though the batter is credited with a hit and the fielder is charged with an error. These known risks, under the contact-sports exception, support a duty of care less stringent than reasonable care."

    "ctx": "A regulatory search is governed by the Fourth Amendment but does not require probable cause as defined traditionally by the courts. In general, probable cause, and the less stringent standard of reasonable suspicion, require particularized suspicion—that is, the officer must have some articulable basis to believe that the individual to be searched or seized has committed or is committing a crime. In contrast, a regulatory search is justified if the state's interest in ensuring that a class of regulated persons is obeying the law outweighs the intrusiveness of a program of searches or seizures of those persons. The origins of the regulatory search doctrine are traced to Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U.S. 523, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 18 L.Ed.2d 930 (1967). The Supreme Court there held that, although health, safety, and fire inspectors could not insist on entering private homes without a search warrant, magistrates could issue warrants to conduct general area inspections without a showing of probable cause to believe that a violation had occurred in a particular building. Id. at 538, 87 S.Ct. at 1735–36. The Court emphasized that the warrant requirement eliminated the inspector's untrammeled discretion, id. at 532–33, 87 S.Ct. at 1732–33, and reasoned that the government's interest in conducting the inspections outweighed the relatively limited intrusion occasioned by such warrants, id. at 536–37, 87 S.Ct. at 1734–35.\nSince Camara, the Supreme Court has expanded the reach of the regulatory search doctrine by permitting, in some circumstances, the warrantless searches of entities doing business in “closely regulated” industries. The Court recently summarized the closely regulated industry line of cases by articulating a three-part test for determining whether a warrant is required for a regulatory search:\nFirst, there must be a “substantial” government interest that informs the regulatory scheme pursuant to which the inspection is made.\nSecond, the warrantless inspections must be “necessary to further [the] regulatory scheme.”....\nFinally, “the statute's inspection program, in terms of the certainty and regularity of its application, [must] provid[e] a constitutionally adequate substitute for a warrant.”"

The anticommandeering doctrine simply represents the recognition of this limit on congressional authority.\nAlthough the anticommandeering principle is simple and basic, it did not emerge in our cases until relatively recently, when Congress attempted in a few isolated instances to extend its authority in unprecedented ways.

In enacting this provision, Congress issued orders to either the legislative or executive branch of state government (depending on the branch authorized by state law to take the actions demanded).

As a claim, the recorded judgment asserts a “right to payment,” albeit a contingent one, subject to the debtor's ability to successfully assert homestead rights under Florida law. See Fla. Stat. § 222.01. Consequently, a recorded judgment, irrespective of its present enforceability, is a prototypical example of a “charge” and falls within the Bankruptcy Code's definition of a “lien.”\nThis conclusion is buttressed by the way Florida treats a recorded judgment against homestead property. Though the recorded judgment cannot be enforced against the homestead, it remains a valid claim and continues to lurk in the public records and follows the property unless the debtor affirmatively acts to remove it by filing a “notice of homestead” and serving it on the judgment creditor. See Fla. Stat. § 222.01. If the creditor disputes the homestead claim, it can mount a challenge by filing an action within 45 days of the notice, and if successful, the recorded judgment, which has lied dormant, awakens and becomes an enforceable judicial lien under Florida law. See Fla. Stat. § 222.01(4).\nSo, what is the recorded judgment before it has been challenged under Fla. Stat. § 222.01? It is, at a minimum, a “claim” asserted against the purported homestead.  Because a recorded judgment is a “claim,” and a “claim” is by definition a “charge,” and a “charge” is, as defined by the Bankruptcy Code, a “lien,” a recorded judgment qualifies as a “lien” as the term is used in § 522(f)(1).4 Although Florida's Constitution prevents a judgment from becoming a “lien” against a Florida homestead under state law, the Recorded Judgment is a lien as defined by the Bankruptcy Code and contemplated by § 522(f)(1)."

The doctrine obviously contemplates not the conceivable chance which a defendant may have to avoid an accident by action undertaken a split second or two sooner, but the clear chance of avoidance, which was available but neglected. In this case the question as to the applicability of the doctrine takes on added difficulty since the accident occurred in the approach to an intersection and happened within a second or two.\nAlthough the doctrine of last clear chance has been expanded by the courts, it must nonetheless apply only when the defendant has failed to exercise a last clear chance to avoid the accident. Commentators have suggested that in a complex industrial society in which ‘the accident toll of our modern way of life is large and inevitable’ (Prof. Fleming James, Jr., ‘Practical Changes in the Field of Negligence,’ 37 Mich. State Bar Jour. (1958), 10, 18), liability should not be dependent upon fault; that the law of negligence may revert to the earlier rules of strict liability; that, indeed, negligence itself was but an outgrowth of the strict law of trespass. One illustration of the trend, according to this analysis, lies in the ‘whittling down of contributory negligence’ and ‘growing recognition of the last clear chance’ doctrine. (P. 13.)"

Depraved heart was defined as an “act eminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved heart, regardless of human life.” Culpable negligence was defined as murder committed “without a depraved heart regardless of human life by such culpably negligent conduct that exhibited or manifested a wanton or reckless disregard for the safety of human life.” Clearly, the difference in the mental state of culpability comes through the jury instructions in that depraved heart murder requires a higher mental culpability, i.e., a depraved heart."

Hare clearly reaffirms the sanctity of the home, Hare, 575 N.W.2d at 832, and Pendleton clarifies that, even absent fear of great bodily harm or death, a person may use deadly force to prevent the commission of a felony in one's home, Pendleton, 567 N.W.2d at 269. These holdings are logically incompatible with a duty to retreat, which would effectively preclude a person from preventing a felony in the home. Mandating a duty to retreat for defense of dwelling claims will force people to leave their homes by the back door while their family members are exposed to danger and their houses are burgled. Further, forcing a resident to retreat from the home is at odds with the historical notion of the home as a place critical for the protection of the family. A duty to retreat is incompatible with the right to prevent the commission of a felony within one's home."

    "question": "Central City in the state of Green is a center for businesses that assemble personal computers. Components for these computers are manufactured elsewhere in Green and in other states, then shipped to Central City, where the computers are assembled. An ordinance of Central City imposes a special license tax on all of the many companies engaged in the business of assembling computers in that city. The tax payable by each such company is a percentage of the company's gross receipts. The Green statute that authorizes municipalities to impose this license tax has a \"Green content\" provision. To comply with this provision of state law, the Central City license tax ordinance provides that the tax paid by any assembler of computers subject to this tax ordinance will be reduced by a percentage equal to the proportion of computer components manufactured in Green. Assembler is a company that assembles computers in Central City and sells them from its offices in Central City to buyers throughout the United States. All of the components of its computers come from outside the state of Green. Therefore, Assembler must pay the Central City license tax in full without receiving any refund. Other Central City computer assemblers use components manufactured in Green in varying proportions and, therefore, are entitled to partial reductions of their Central City license tax payments. Following prescribed procedure, Assembler brings an action in a proper court asking to have Central City's special license tax declared unconstitutional on the ground that it is inconsistent with the negative implications of the commerce clause.

See, e.g., Hughes v. Oklahoma, 441 U.S. 322, 326, 99 S.Ct. 1727, 1731, 60 L.Ed.2d 250 (1979); H.P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v.

This “negative” aspect of the Commerce Clause prohibits economic protectionism-that is, regulatory measures designed to benefit in-state economic interests by burdening out-of-state competitors. *274 See, e.g., Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U.S. 263, 270-273, 104 S.Ct. 3049, 3054-3056, 82 L.Ed.2d 200 (1984); H.P. Hood & Sons, supra, 336 U.S., at 532-533, 69 S.Ct., at 662; Guy v. Baltimore, 100 U.S. (10 Otto) 434, 443, 25 L.Ed. 743 (1880). Thus, state statutes that clearly discriminate against interstate commerce are routinely struck down, see, e.g., Sporhase v. Nebraska ex rel. Douglas, 458 U.S. 941, 102 S.Ct. 3456, 73 L.Ed.2d 1254 (1982); Lewis v. BT Investment Managers, **1808 Inc., 447 U.S. 27, 100 S.Ct. 2009, 64 L.Ed.2d 702 (1980); Dean Milk Co. v. Madison, 340 U.S. 349, 71 S.Ct. 295, 95 L.Ed. 329 (1951), unless the discrimination is demonstrably justified by a valid factor unrelated to economic protectionism, see, e.g., Maine v.

The Rapido has an excellent reputation for mechanical reliability with one exception, that the motor may stall if the engine has not had an extended warm-up. Driver had just begun to drive her Rapido in city traffic without a warm-up when the engine suddenly stalled. A car driven by Troody rear- ended Driver's car. Driver suffered no external physical injuries as a result of the collision. However, the shock of the crash caused her to suffer a severe heart attack. Driver brought an action against the Rapido Motor Co. based on strict liability in tort.

While in the course of their employment, the three employees of Red negligently released into local Blue waterways some of the chemical samples they had received from the laboratory in Blue. Persons in Blue injured by the release of the chemicals sued the three Red state employees and the state of Red in Blue state courts for the damages they suffered. After a trial in which all of the defendants admitted jurisdiction of the Blue state court and fully participated, plaintiffs received a judgment against all of the defendants for $5 million, which became final. Subsequently, plaintiffs sought to enforce their Blue state court judgment by commencing a proper proceeding in an appropriate court of Red. In that enforcement proceeding, the state of Red argued, as it had done unsuccessfully in the earlier action in Blue state court, that its liability is limited by a law of Red to $100,000 in any tort case. Because the three individual employees of Red are able to pay only $50,000 of the judgment, the only way the injured persons can fully satisfy their Blue state court judgment is from the funds of the state of Red.

Baker held record title in fee simple to Blueacre, which adjoined Greenacre. Twelve years ago Charlie succeeded to Able's title in fee simple in Greenacre and seven years ago Dorcas succeeded to Baker's title in fee simple in Blueacre by a deed which made no mention of a right-of-way or driveway. At the time Dorcas took title, there existed a driveway across Greenacre which showed evidence that it had been used regularly to travel between Main Road, a public road, and Blueacre. Blueacre did have frontage on Side Road, another public road, but this means of access was seldom used because it was not as convenient to the dwelling situated on Blueacre as was Main Road.

    "ctx": "In this case, the focus of our inquiry must be on the crèche in the context of the Christmas season. See, e.g., Stone v. Graham, 449 U.S. 39, 101 S.Ct. 192, 66 L.Ed.2d 199 (1980) (per curiam ); Abington School District v. Schempp, supra. In Stone, for example, we invalidated a state statute requiring the posting of a copy of the Ten Commandments on public classroom walls. But the Court carefully pointed out that the Commandments were posted purely as a religious admonition, not “integrated into the school curriculum, where the Bible may constitutionally be used in an appropriate study of history, civilization, ethics, comparative religion, or the like.” 449 U.S., at 42, 101 S.Ct., at 194. Similarly, in Abington, although the Court struck down the practices in two States requiring daily Bible readings in public schools, it specifically noted that nothing in the Court's holding was intended to “indicat[e] that such study of the Bible or of religion, when presented objectively as part of a secular program of education, may not be effected consistently *680 with the First Amendment.” 374 U.S., at 225, 83 S.Ct., at 1573. Focus exclusively on the religious component of any activity would inevitably lead to its invalidation under the Establishment Clause.\nThe Court has invalidated legislation or governmental action on the ground that a secular purpose was lacking, but only when it has concluded there was no question that the statute or activity was motivated wholly by religious considerations. See, e.g., Stone v. Graham, supra, 449 U.S., at 41, 101 S.Ct., at 193; Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U.S. 97, 107–109, 89 S.Ct. 266, 272–273, 21 L.Ed.2d 228 (1968); Abington School District v. Schempp, supra, 374 U.S., at 223–224, 83 S.Ct., at 1572; Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421, 424–425, 82 S.Ct. 1261, 1263–1264, 8 L.Ed.2d 601 (1962). Even where the benefits to religion were substantial, as in Everson, supra; Board of Education v. Allen, 392 U.S. 236, 88 S.Ct. 1923, 20 L.Ed.2d 1060 (1968), Walz, supra, and Tilton, supra, we saw a secular purpose and no conflict with the Establishment Clause. Cf. Larkin v. Grendel's Den, 459 U.S. 116, 103 S.Ct. 505, 74 L.Ed.2d 297 (1982).\nThe District Court inferred from the religious nature of the crèche that the City has no secular purpose for the display. In so doing, it rejected the City's claim that its reasons for including the crèche are essentially the same as its reasons for sponsoring the display as a whole. The District Court plainly erred by focusing almost exclusively on the crèche. When viewed in the proper context of the Christmas Holiday season, it is apparent that, on this record, there is insufficient evidence to establish that the inclusion of the crèche is a purposeful or surreptitious effort to express some kind of subtle governmental advocacy of a particular religious message. In a pluralistic society a variety of motives and purposes are implicated. The City, like the Congresses and Presidents, however, has principally taken note of a significant historical religious event long celebrated in the Western World. The crèche in the display depicts the historical origins of this traditional event long recognized as a National Holiday. See *681 Allen v. Hickel, 424 F.2d 944 (CADC 1970); Citizens Concerned for Separation of Church and State v. City and County of Denver, 526 F.Supp. 1310 (D Colo.1981).\nThe narrow question is whether there is a secular purpose for Pawtucket's display of the crèche. The display is sponsored by the City to celebrate the Holiday and to depict the origins of that Holiday. These are legitimate secular purposes. The District Court's inference, drawn from the religious nature of the crèche, that the City has no secular purpose was, on this record, clearly erroneous.\nThe District Court found that the primary effect of including the crèche is to confer a substantial and impermissible benefit on religion in general and on the Christian faith in particular. Comparisons of the relative benefits to religion of different forms of governmental support are elusive and difficult to make. But to conclude that the primary effect of including the crèche is to advance religion in violation of the Establishment Clause would require that we view it as more beneficial to and more an endorsement of religion, for example, than expenditure of large sums of public money for textbooks supplied throughout the country to students attending church-sponsored schools, Board of Education v. Allen, supra; expenditure of public funds for transportation of *682 students to church-sponsored schools, Everson v. Board of Education, supra; federal grants for college buildings of church-sponsored institutions of higher education combining secular and religious education, Tilton, supra; noncategorical grants to church-sponsored colleges and universities, Roemer v. Board of Public Works, 426 U.S. 736, 96 S.Ct. 2337, 49 L.Ed.2d 179 (1976); and the tax exemptions for church properties sanctioned in Walz, supra. It would also require that we view it as more of an endorsement of religion than the Sunday Closing Laws upheld in McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 81 S.Ct. 1101, 6 L.Ed.2d 393 (1961); the release time program for religious training in Zorach, supra; and the legislative prayers upheld in Marsh, supra.\nWe are unable to discern a greater aid to religion deriving from inclusion of the crèche than from these benefits and endorsements previously held not violative of the Establishment Clause. What was said about the legislative prayers in Marsh, supra, 463 U.S., at ––––, 103 S.Ct., at 3336, and implied about the Sunday Closing Laws in McGowan is true of the City's inclusion of the crèche: its “reason or effect merely happens to coincide or harmonize with the tenets of some ... religions.” See McGowan, supra, 366 U.S., at 442, 81 S.Ct., at 1113."

In such an event the second prosecution is not for the same offense as the first; and the reason for this is, as is well stated in Wharton on Criminal Pleading and Practice, ninth edition, section 476, ‘that as at the time of conviction of assault there could have been no conviction of the homicide the prosecution of the homicide is not barred by the conviction of the assault.’ [Citation.] ...

The Court determined that the landlord had “a legal duty to take reasonable security measures for tenant protection on the premises” because the criminal conduct was foreseeable. Id. at 231, 412 A.2d 436; see also Wlasiuk v. McElwee, 334 N.J.Super. 661, 667–68, 760 A.2d 829 (App.Div.2000) (driver of motor vehicle liable to passenger injured by criminal act of *433 stranger whom driver allowed into vehicle, because risk of harm from giving rides to strangers was reasonably foreseeable); Ventresco v. Gokvlesh Convenience, 318 N.J.Super. 473, 478, 723 A.2d 1250 (App.Div.1999) (“All that is required is sufficient information to apprise the proprietor of the existence of danger and enough time to act on behalf of the patron's safety.”); Picco v. Fords Diner, Inc., 113 N.J.Super. 465, 467, 274 A.2d 301 (App.Div.1971) (“Absence of any night illumination of ... parking area might reasonably be considered a dereliction on the part of defendant, which contributed proximately to the criminal assault.... It is common knowledge that lighting an area during nighttime hours deters criminal activity.” **849 ). These decisions imposed liability upon defendants for failure to protect against the criminal propensities of third persons where the likelihood of serious harm could be easily anticipated and the defendants failed to take reasonable measures to prevent the harm.\nPublic policy considerations are also important when determining whether a duty exists. Plaintiffs argue that because there are thousands of deaths each year from gun violence, there is a strong public need to prevent easy access to firearms. In Kelly v. Gwinnell, 96 N.J. 538, 476 A.2d 1219 (1984), the New Jersey Supreme Court determined that a social host could be liable for injuries to a plaintiff resulting from a drunk driving accident. Id. at 548, 476 A.2d 1219. Chief Justice Wilentz noted that the host could foresee quite clearly that the “continued provision of alcohol to [the driver] was making it more and more likely that [the driver] would not be able to operate his car carefully.” Id. at 544, 476 A.2d 1219. Nevertheless, the primary issue focused on whether the host owed a duty to public users of the highway. Social considerations weighed heavily in the Court's decision to impose such a duty. “In a society where thousands of deaths are caused each year by drunken drivers ... the imposition of a duty is both consistent with and supportive of a social goal—the reduction of drunk driving....” Id. at 544–45, 476 A.2d 1219. In Kelly, the Court determined that a social host's liability “proceeds from the duty of care that accompanies control of the liquor supply.” *434 Id. at 548, 476 A.2d 1219. Similarly, Adventure Sport controlled their inventory of handguns and derived a profit from the sale of firearms."

    "ctx": "Because the ordinance is not related to the exercise of a fundamental right or based on a suspect trait, it need only rationally relate to some legitimate governmental interest. Under the Equal Protection Clause, which is implicated because the ordinance treats some city employees differently from others, a governmental classification must be necessary to promote a compelling state interest when it relates to who may exercise a fundamental right or when it is based on a suspect trait (e.g., race or national origin). If a quasi-suspect classification (e.g., gender or legitimacy) is involved, the classification will be upheld if it is substantially related to an important government interest. In all other cases, the classification is valid if there is any conceivable basis on which it might relate to any legitimate governmental interest. This \"rational basis\" test is used for all classifications that relate only to matters of economics or social welfare. The right of police officers and firefighters to hold second jobs is not a fundamental right that will trigger strict scrutiny. In addition, the ordinance is not based on a suspect or quasi-suspect classification. Therefore, the validity of the ordinance is judged according to the \"rational basis\" test. A party attacking a classification under this test bears the difficult burden of demonstrating to the court that the classification does not have a rational relationship to a legitimate interest of government."

The states of East Winnetka and West Hampton permit the hunting and trapping of snipe, but the state of Midland strictly forbids these activities in order to protect snipe, a rare species of animal, from extinction. The state of Midland has a state statute that provides, \"Possession of snipe traps is prohibited. Any game warden finding a snipe trap within the state shall seize and destroy it.\" Snipe traps cost about $15 each. Prentis is a resident of West Hampton and an ardent snipe trapper. She drove her car to East Winnetka to purchase a new improved snipe trap from a manufacturer there. In the course of her trip back across Midland with the trap in her car, Prentis stopped in a Midland state park to camp for a few nights. While she was in that park, a Midland game warden saw the trap, which was visible on the front seat of her car. The warden seized the trap and destroyed it in accordance with the Midland statute after Prentis admitted that the seized item was a prohibited snipe trap. No federal statutes or federal administrative regulations apply. For this question only, assume that Prentis demonstrates that common carriers are permitted to transport snipe traps as cargo across Midland for delivery to another state and that in practice the Midland statute is enforced only against private individuals transporting those traps in private vehicles.

Learning of their mother's plight, Alice and Barry agreed with each other in a signed writing that on the last day of January and each succeeding month during their mother's lifetime, each would give Elda $500. Elda then hired the companion. Alice and Barry made the agreed payments in January, February, and March. In April, however, Barry refused to make any payment and notified Alice and Elda that he would make no further payments. Will Elda succeed in an action for $500 brought against Barry after April 30?",

Occasionally, Daniel made repairs to the old road. The period of time to acquire rights by prescription in the jurisdiction is ten years. After the expiration of 15 years, Beach conveyed a portion of Blackacre to Carrol. The deed included the following clause: \"together with the right to pass and repass at all times and for all purposes over the old road.\" Carrol built a house fronting on the old road. The road was severely damaged by a spring flood, and Carrol made substantial repairs to the road. Carrol asked Daniel and Beach to contribute one-third each to the cost of repairing the flood damage.

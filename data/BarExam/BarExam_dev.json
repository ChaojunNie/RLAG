    "gold_passage": "Executive Power: An Overview\nIn its first three articles, the U.S. Constitution outlines the branches of the U.S. Government, the powers that they contain and the limitations to which they must adhere. Article II outlines the duties of the Executive Branch.\n\nThe President of the United States is elected to a four-year term by electors from every state and the District of Columbia. The electors make up the Electoral College, which is comprised of 538 electors, equal to the number of Representatives and Senators that currently make up Congress. The citizens of each state vote for slates of electors who then vote for the President on the prescribed day, selected by Congress.\n\nTo become President, a person must be a natural born citizen of the United States. Naturalized citizens are ineligible, as are persons under the age of 35. In the case that the President should be unable to perform his duties, the Vice-President becomes the President. Amendment XXII placed a two-term limit on the presidential office.\n\nThe President:\nis the Commander in Chief of the armed forces. He or she has the power to call into service the state units of the National Guard, and in times of emergency may be given the power by Congress to manage national security or the economy.\nhas the power to make treaties with Senate approval. He or she can also receive ambassadors and work with leaders of other nations.\nis responsible for nominating the heads of governmental departments, federal judges, and Supreme Court justices. The U.S. Senate is charged with approving these nominations.\ncan issue executive orders, which have the force of law but do not have to be approved by Congress.\ncan issue pardons for federal offenses.\ncan convene Congress for special sessions.\ncan veto legislation approved by Congress. However, the veto is limited. It is not a line-item veto, meaning that the President must veto the entire bill, rather than parts of it. Further, a presidential veto can be overridden by a two-thirds vote by Congress.\ndelivers the State of the Union address annually to a joint session of Congress.\nWar Powers\nCongress holds the power to declare war. As a result, the President cannot declare war without their approval. However, as the Commander in Chief of the armed forces, Presidents have sent troops to battle without an official war declaration (which happened in Vietnam and Korea). The 1973 War Powers Act attempted to define when and how the President could send troops to battle by adding strict time frames for reporting to Congress after sending troops to war, in addition to other measures, however it has not had much effect (see \"War Powers Resolution\" section in the Commander in Chief Powers article).\n\nNominations\nThe President is responsible for nominating candidates for the head positions of government offices. The President will typically nominate cabinet officials and secretaries at the beginning of his or her presidency and will fill vacancies as necessary. In addition, the President is responsible for nominating Federal Circuit Court judges and Supreme Court justices and choosing the chief justice. These nominations must be confirmed by the Senate. While the President usually has broad appointment powers, subject to Senate approval, there are some limitations. In National Labor Relations Board v. SW General Inc. (2017), the Supreme Court found that the \"Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 [FVRA], which prevents a person who has been nominated to fill a vacant office requiring presidential appointment and Senate confirmation from performing the duties of that office in an acting capacity, applies to anyone performing acting service under the FVRA.\"\n\nFurther, the President is constitutionally allowed to make recess appointments when Senate is not in session (which means that such appointments are not subject to Senate approval until the end of the session). However, In National Labor Relations Board v. Noel Canning, the Supreme Court found that \"for purposes of the clause, the Senate is in session whenever it indicates that it is, as long as – under its own rules – it retains the capacity to transact Senate business.\" As such, the Senate can claim to always be in session, therefore preventing the President from making any recess appointments.\n\nExecutive Orders\nIn times of emergency, the President can override Congress and issue executive orders with almost limitless power. Abraham Lincoln used an executive order in order to fight the Civil War, Woodrow Wilson issued numerous ones related to US involvement in World War I, and Franklin Roosevelt approved Japanese internment camps during World War II with an executive order.\n\nPardons\nThe U.S. Constitution gives the President almost limitless power to grant pardons to those convicted of federal crimes. While the President cannot pardon someone impeached by Congress, he or she can pardon anyone else without any Congressional involvement.\n\nThe Extent of the President's Powers\nArticle II of the Constitution contains the vesting clause, which states: \"The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.\" This has historically been interpreted to mean that the President is the head of the Executive Branch, but that he is still subject to limits within that Branch (i.e. if the President fires members of the Executive Branch, Congress would have oversight and would be able to investigate the firings.) Some scholars, however, have interpreted the Vesting Clause under a much stronger lens, finding that the President has full power over the entire Executive Branch. Under this theory, commonly referred to as the Unitary Executive Theory, any decision that the President makes regarding the Executive Branch would not be subject to any sort of review or oversight (i.e. Congress would not be able to investigate the President's firings of any members of the Executive Branch). While the Supreme Court has not directly embraced or rejected this theory, Justice Alito has made comments which have caused some to think that he endorses the theory: \"The president has not just some executive powers, but the executive power — the whole thing.\"",

    "answer_idx":  "A",
    "gold_passage": "Although the Constitution does not expressly authorize Congress to conduct investigations, Congress – and the courts – have long recognized that Congress has an inherent, constitutional prerogative to conduct investigations.  In fact, the first congressional investigation occurred as early as 1792, when the House of Representatives convened a committee to investigate the defeat of General Arthur St. Clair in the Battle of the Wabash in what was then known as the Northwest Territory (and now known as Ohio). Congress has the authority to conduct investigations “in aid of its legislative function.”  That authority can extend to investigations for the purpose of deciding whether legislation is appropriate, to information gathering on matters of national importance, to oversight of federal departments and executive agencies.  As a result, a congressional committee has broad discretion regarding both the scope of its investigation and the relevance of the information it requests. Although congressional authority to investigate is broad, it is not unlimited.  Because Congress’s authority to investigate is tied to its authority to legislate, limits on congressional investigations are necessarily linked to the limits on Congress’s constitutional authority.  For example, Congress has no general authority to investigate the purely private affair of an ordinary citizen. The doctrine of separation of powers also places limits on congressional authority to investigate.  Congress cannot, under the guise of an investigation, usurp the power of another branch of government.  It cannot investigate matters where the means of redress is purely judicial.  Nor can Congress investigate matters committed to the President’s discretion.  For example, Congress could not undertake an investigation to determine an individual’s entitlement to a pardon because the Constitution granted the pardon power to the President, not Congress. While Congress can investigate conduct that may be criminal, Congress itself lacks the authority to bring criminal charges or otherwise initiate a criminal prosecution.  If a congressional investigation uncovers evidence of criminal activity, however, Congress may refer the matter to the Department of Justice for investigation and, potentially, prosecution.  Sometimes, the DOJ investigation predates the congressional investigation.  No matter which branch of government moves first to investigate, however, the end result is that a congressional investigation often will run parallel to a criminal investigation.  As a result, evidence developed in a congressional investigation might be used by the DOJ in its criminal investigation or in a prosecution. Ultimately, nearly any matter can be anchored in some fashion to Congress’s legislative authority, making its authority to investigate almost boundless in practice.  That reality is compounded by expansive interpretations of congressional authority and a hesitation by the courts to intervene in congressional investigations.",

In addressing a case involving a license to prospect and mine ore, the Utah Supreme Court discussed the potential for a mining license to ripen into an incorporeal hereditament and stated: This is not to say that a license is an incorporeal hereditament; it means that the grant was a license as long as it remained executory because it was not in proper form for a conveyance of an incorporeal hereditament. It ripened into an incorporeal hereditament when the licensee entered into enjoyment thereof and made expenditures and improvements. Other jurisdictions hold that revocation will not be allowed in such a case unless the licensee be compensated for his improvements.\nThis language supports a conclusion that the holder of an incorporeal hereditament would be considered the holder of a form of property interest entitling it to compensation under Utah law.",

She instructed her lawyer by telephone to prepare a deed conveying Blackacre, a large tract of undeveloped land, as a gift to her nephew, Bernard, who lived in a distant state. Her instructions were followed, and, prior to her surgery, she executed a document in a form sufficient to constitute a deed of conveyance. The deed was recorded by the lawyer promptly and properly as she instructed him to do. The recorded deed was returned to the lawyer by the land record office, Anna, in fact, recovered from her surgery and the lawyer returned the recorded deed to her. Before Anna or the lawyer thought to inform Bernard of the conveyance, Bernard was killed in an auto accident. Bernard's will left all of his estate to a satanic religious cult. Anna was very upset at the prospect of the cult's acquiring Blackacre. The local taxing authority assessed the next real property tax bill on Blackacre to Bernard's estate. Anna brought an appropriate action against Bernard's estate and the cult to set aside the conveyance to Bernard. If Anna loses, it will be because",

    "gold_passage": "Circumstantial evidence is evidence that relies on an inference to connect it to a conclusion of fact. Direct evidence, by contrast, supports the truth of a fact without the need for additional evidence or inference. Circumstantial evidence is legal evidence and the jury must consider it when it is sufficient to sustain or negate a party's burden of proof.1 Circumstantial evidence has probative value equal to that of testimonial direct evidence.\nMany forms of circumstantial evidence have a logical tendency to prove or disprove some fact in issue. They may or may not be admissible depending upon considerations of public policy, as well as the relevancy and materiality of the testimony. In the absence of a statute or a valid and binding contractual provision to the contrary, circumstantial evidence is regarded by law as competent to prove any given fact in issue in a civil case and is sometimes as cogent and valuable as direct and positive testimony. Upon the issue of reasonableness of conduct, all the surrounding circumstances become facts material to the case. Circumstantial evidence may be used to establish liability where it negates other reasonable causes for injury.\nTort claims may be established entirely by circumstantial evidence. Similarly, proximate cause may be proved by circumstantial evidence even though there is no eyewitness evidence. The law does not require every fact and circumstance which make up a case of negligence to be proved by direct and positive testimony or by the testimony of eyewitnesses. Negligence and freedom from contributory negligence may be shown by circumstantial, as well as the conditions and circumstances leading up to and surrounding the incident causing the plaintiff's injury. Similarly, the terms of an oral contract, and the assent of the parties to it, may be shown by the actions of the parties and attending circumstances, as well as by the words they use. In accordance with the rules for the construction of contracts, where a contract is ambiguous on its face, evidence of the surrounding circumstances and the subsequent conduct of the parties in the execution of the contract is admissible to interpret the contract; and the circumstances in which the parties to a contract are placed are generally admissible where such evidence will shed light upon issues in the case. In many instances, facts can be proved only by circumstantial evidence. Such evidence may in fact be the only means of proving intent, knowledge, fraud, or illicit sexual relations.\nCircumstantial evidence must do more than raise a suspicion. It must amount to proof. There must be some reasonable connection between the facts proved and the fact at issue. A fact cannot be established by circumstantial evidence where there is direct, uncontradicted, reasonable, and unimpeached evidence that the fact does not exist. In some instances, circumstantial evidence may outweigh or be more satisfactory or convincing than direct or positive testimony. Circumstantial evidence cannot be based on mere speculation, guess, or conjecture; it must justify an inference of probability as distinguished from possibility.\nThe court is given the discretion to determine when circumstantial evidence should be admitted. This may require the court to evaluate the evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 403 to determine whether its prejudicial effect substantially outweighs its probative value. One court provided this observation about a court's discretion to allow circumstantial evidence:\nAs has been frequently said, great latitude is allowed in the reception of circumstantial evidence, the aid of which is constantly required, and therefore, where direct evidence of the fact is wanting, the more the jury can see of the surrounding facts and circumstances, the more correct their judgment is likely to be. The competency of a collateral fact to be used as the basis of legitimate argument is not to be determined by the conclusiveness of the inferences it may afford in reference to the litigated fact. It is enough if these may tend, even in a slight degree, to elucidate the inquiry, or to assist, though remotely, to a determination probably founded in truth. The modern tendency, both of legislation and of the decision of courts, is to give as wide a scope as possible to the investigation of facts.",

See Davis v. United States, 564 U.S. ––––, 131 S.Ct. 2419, 2426–27, 180 L.Ed.2d 285 (2011).

To be guilty of arson, he must have had the intent to start or maintain a fire. See Henderson v. State, 715 So.2d 863 (Ala.Crim.App.1997); Minnis v. State, 690 So.2d 521 (Ala.Crim.App.1996). “The *851 doctrine of universal malice, depraved heart murder, or reckless homicide manifesting extreme indifference to human life is intended to embrace those cases where a person has no deliberate intent to kill or injure any particular individual.” Haney v. State, 603 So.2d 368, 399 (Ala.Crim.App.1991), aff'd, 603 So.2d 412 (Ala.1992).\nAssuming, without deciding, that the jury's verdicts in this case were inconsistent, we conclude that they were not mutually exclusive.1 We have carefully examined the appellant's acts and the offenses for which the jury found him guilty. Based on that review, we find that it was not legally impossible for the State to prove the elements of both offenses because no element of either offense negates an element of the other. Even though reckless murder involves a situation in which the defendant does not intend to kill or injure another person, it does not require that none of his actions be intentional. For example, it does not exclude the possibility that he committed another intentional act, such as setting a fire. Thus, the jury could have reasonably concluded that the appellant acted with extreme indifference to human life but did not intend to kill or injure the victim when he threw gasoline around the den; that the appellant acted intentionally when he started the fire; and that the victim died as a result of both of the appellant's actions. Therefore, the verdicts were not mutually exclusive. Cf. Martinez v. State, [Ms. CR-05-1669, March 2, 2007] --- So.2d ----, ---- (Ala.Crim.App.2007) (opinion on return to remand) (applying Heard and holding that the jury's verdicts were mutually exclusive because a single act cannot be both negligent and reckless). Accordingly, the appellant's argument is without merit, and we affirm the trial court's judgment.",

    "gold_passage": "The Appointments Clause of Article II of the Constitution reads as follows:\n“[The President] shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.” U.S. Const., Art. II, § 2, cl. 2.\n5678As we recognized in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 125, 96 S.Ct. 612, 685, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976) (per curiam), the Appointments Clause of Article II is more than a matter of “etiquette or protocol”; it is among the significant structural safeguards of the constitutional scheme. By vesting the President with the exclusive power to select the principal (noninferior) officers of the United States, the Appointments Clause prevents congressional encroachment upon the Executive and Judicial Branches. See id., at 128–131, 96 S.Ct., at 686–688; Weiss, supra, at 183–185, 114 S.Ct., at 763–765 (SOUTER, J., concurring); Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U.S. 868, 904, and n. 4, 111 S.Ct. 2631, 2652, and n. 4, 115 L.Ed.2d 764 (1991) (SCALIA, J., concurring). This disposition was also designed to assure a higher quality of appointments: The Framers anticipated that the President would be less vulnerable to interest-group pressure and personal favoritism than would a collective body. “The sole and undivided responsibility of one man will naturally beget a livelier sense of duty, and a more exact regard to reputation.” The Federalist No. 76, p. 387 (M. Beloff ed. 1987) (A. Hamilton); accord, 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States 374–375 (1833). The President's power to select principal officers of the United States was not left unguarded, however, as Article II further requires the “Advice and Consent of the Senate.” This serves both to curb Executive abuses of the appointment power, see 3 Story, supra, at 376–377, and “to promote a judicious choice of [persons] for filling the offices of the union,” The Federalist No. 76, at 386–387. *660 By requiring the joint participation of the President and the Senate, the Appointments Clause was designed to ensure public accountability for both the making of a bad appointment and the rejection of a good one. Hamilton observed:\n“The blame of a bad nomination would fall upon the president singly and absolutely. The censure of rejecting a good one would lie entirely at the door of the senate; aggravated by the consideration of their having counteracted the good intentions of the executive. If an ill appointment should be made, the executive for nominating, and the senate for approving, would participate, though in different degrees, in the opprobrium and disgrace.” Id., No. 77, at 392.\nSee also 3 Story, supra, at 375 (“If [the President] should ... surrender the public patronage into the hands of profligate men, or low adventurers, it will be impossible for him long to retain public favour”).\n \nThe prescribed manner of appointment for principal officers is also the default manner of appointment for inferior officers. “[B]ut,” the Appointments Clause continues, “the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.” This provision, sometimes referred to as the “Excepting Clause,” was added to the proposed Constitution on the last day of the Grand Convention, with little discussion. See 2 M. Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, pp. 627–628 (1911 ed.). As one of our early opinions suggests, its obvious purpose is administrative convenience, see United States v. Germaine, 99 U.S. 508, 510, 25 L.Ed. 482 (1879)—but that convenience was deemed to outweigh the benefits of the more cumbersome procedure only with respect to the appointment of “inferior Officers.” Section 323(a), which confers appointment power upon the Secretary of Transportation, can constitutionally be *661 applied to the appointment of Court of Criminal Appeals judges only if those judges are “inferior Officers.”\n Our cases have not set forth an exclusive criterion for distinguishing between principal and inferior officers for Appointments Clause purposes. Among the offices that we have found to be inferior are that of a district court clerk, Ex parte Hennen, 38 U.S. (13 Pet.) 225, 229, 10 L.Ed. 136 (1839), an election supervisor, Ex parte Siebold, 100 U.S. 371, 397–398, 25 L.Ed. 717 (1880), a vice consul charged temporarily with the duties of the consul, United States v. Eaton, 169 U.S. 331, 343, 18 S.Ct. 374, 379, 42 L.Ed. 767 (1898), and a “United States commissioner” in district court proceedings, Go–Bart Importing Co. v. United States, 282 U.S. 344, 352–354, 51 S.Ct. 153, 156–157, 75 L.Ed. 374 (1931). Most recently, in Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 108 S.Ct. 2597, 101 L.Ed.2d 569 (1988), we held that the independent counsel created by provisions of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 28 U.S.C. §§ 591–599, was an inferior officer. In reaching that conclusion, we relied on several factors: that the independent counsel was subject to removal by a higher officer (the Attorney General), that she performed only limited duties, that her jurisdiction was narrow, and that her tenure was limited. 487 U.S., at 671–672, 108 S.Ct., at 2608–2609.",

Frontier Theatres, 369 S.W.2d at 305, the loss in value to her.

Henry agreed to let him sleep on a couch in the basement. During the course of the night, Henry began to doubt the story Scott had told him. Early the next morning, Henry called the police and said he was suspicious and frightened of a stranger whom he had allowed to stay the night. The police went immediately to the house to assist Henry and walked through the open front door. They found Scott and Henry drinking coffee in the kitchen. When they saw Scott, they realized he matched the description of the drugstore robber. They arrested Scott and in his jacket they found drugs taken during the robbery.

In contrast to the common law rule, the Restatement rule reflects a policy against awarding a windfall to the non-breaching party. See id. at 119–20. The court in Lancellotti rejected the view that breach is morally wrong, see id. at 122 (“Rules of contract law are not rules of punishment; *323 the contract breaker is not an outlaw.” (internal quotation marks omitted)), and joined the many other jurisdictions that had already adopted Restatement Section 374. See id. at 120–21.\n Under the Restatement, a breaching party can recover for the value of benefits conferred in excess of damages. The contract price is frequently used as evidence of the value of the benefit conferred. See generally Corbin on Contracts, supra, § 1124 & n.17, at 104. ",
